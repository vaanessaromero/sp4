To provide notes on the species composition and the abundance and size of commonly encountered macrobenthic reef invertebrates, belt transectssurvey in intertidal, shallow , and deep subtidal reef habitats were conducted. In total, 18 species were recorded, six of which were echinoderms and 12 were mollusks, which include the rare giant clam  Hippopus por cellanus .  Only the giant clam  Tridacna cr ocea and the top shell  Trochus niloticus  occurred in all seven permanent monitoring sites but the two species varied in densities across depths. There was alsoan outbreak of crown-of-thorns (COT s) sea stars in some sites. The large variation in the density of each species across sites and depths suggests niche differences, overharvesting, or their recovery fromhaving been overly exploited. Separate monitoring areas for each commercially important species are suggested to determine how their populations respond to poaching and their implications on the park’s long term management. Key words:  Macrobenthic invertebrates, marine protected area, Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park Dolorosa, R.G. and Jontila, J.B.S. 2 Science Diliman (July-December 2012)  24:2, 1-11 INTRODUCTION Situated within the Coral  Triangle, the  Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (TRNP) harbors some of the richest marine ecosystems in the world (White and Cruz- T rinidad 1998,  Arquiza and White 1999,  White and Vogt 2000). Covering an area of 96,828 ha, TRNP is thecountry’ s largest Marine Protected  Area (MPA) and the sole, pure marine  World Heritage Site in Southeast Asia (Songco and Jack 2009). The North and South Atolls and Jessie Beazley Reef that comprise it feature spectacular reef formations teeming with marine life (Dygico 2006).  Its strategic location in the middle of the Sulu Sea makes it an important source of fish and coral larvae that enrich the fisheries of eastern coast of Palawan (see  White and Vogt 2000). But like many other reefs, TRNP has always been a target of illegalfishermen before and even after its declaration as a national park in 1988 (TMO unpublished data,  Arquiza and White 1999, Dygico 2006, Dolorosa and others2010, Jontila and others 201 1).  Such is a challenge to the management in preserving the globally significantbiological diversity and ecological processes of  TRNP. To ef ficiently manage the park, monitoring ef forts were conducted as early as the 1990s, but it was only in 1997 that monitoring and evaluation were undertaken more systematically . Seven permanent monitoring sites for fish and corals at 10 m depths were establishedthen and in 2002, replicates at depths of 5 m were added in the same sites  (Ledesma and others 2008).  Between 1997 and 2005, studies on seabirds, seagrass, planktons, large predators including sharks and cetaceans, and focal benthic mollusks species were conducted sporadically .  A  survey of focal benthic mollusks in 2005 followed the transect lines for coral monitoring, whichwas at 5 m and 10 m depths, with one additional transect in the intertidal area (Dolorosa and Schoppe 2005). W ith the incidence of illegal collection of the reef gastropod topshell  Trochus niloticus  or ‘trochus’ in 2006, the management immediately facilitated the gathering of baseline data. Seven permanent monitoring stations in the shallow subtidal areas (~1 m deep during low tide) were established and marked with cement blocks (see Dolorosa and others 2010).  During the second trochus monitoring in 2008, efforts were exerted at noting other macrobenthic invertebrates occurring within the trochus habitat in terms of species Figure 1.  T ubbataha Reefs Natural Park Map showing its location in the Philippines (upper right) and the permanent monitoring sites (modified af ter Tubbat aha Management Office Brochure) composition, abundance and size. Information on such is necessary to aid the management in safeguarding the species against illegal collectors. Knowing where these species abound would help the management maximize their resources by focusing more on “hot spot” areas that need greater protection. METHODSThe study was conducted in the South and North Atolls of  TRNP  (8°43’-8°57’  N latitude and 1 19°48’-120°3’ E longitude). The park is located amidst Sulu Sea, some 150 km southeast of Puerto Princesa City , Palawan and 130 km south of Cagayancillo, the municipalitywhere the park belongs (Figure 1). Between May 27 and June 3, 2008, the seven permanent monitoring sites established in 2006 (see Dolorosa and others 2010) at the shallow subtidal (~1.0 m deep at low tide) areas were revisited (Figure 1) and replicates in intertidal (exposed at low tide) areas and at ~5 m deep reef slope were added. The selected areas were generally composed of rock substrates that favor the abundance of trochus. Belt Common macrobenthic reef invertebrates of Tubbataha3 Science Diliman  (July-December 2012)  24:2, 1-11 transects (100 m x 2 m) positioned parallel to the shoreline to record the abundance of echinoderms and macrobenthic mollusks were surveyed with the use of SCUBA gears. In total, 21 transects were surveyed covering 4,200 m2. The sizes of reef gastropods were measured either with a plastic ruler glued on a slateboard or with calipers. The relaxed lengths of sea cucumbers were measured with a tape measure. Noteworthy macrobenthic reef invertebrates encountered outside but along the transect lines were noted. Field identification of mollusks were based on the works of Poutiers (1998a, 1998b) and Springsteen and Leobrera (1986), while for echinoderms, the works of Conand (1998) and Schoppe (2000) were used. RESUL TS Species compositionIn total, 18 species were recorded, six of which were echinoderms and the rests were mollusks. The echinoderms were composed of Crown-of-thorns (COTs) sea star , Acanthaster planci , and five species of sea cucumbers. The 12 macrobenthic mollusks were composed of eight gastropods and four bivalves, all of which were giant clams.   All, except the three sea cucumber species ( Bohadscia argus, Stichopus chlor onotus , and Thelenota ananas )  and three mollusk species ( Bursa bubo, Chiragra chiragra , and T ridacna  squamosa ), occurred within the belt transects (T able 1). Abundance and size There was a large variation in the abundance of species across sites (T able 2) and depths (T able 3).  The COTs were only noted in deep reef slopes of Sites 1 and 4(T ables 2 and 3). No size measurement was taken for the COT s but their approximate diameter ranged between 20 and 40 cm. Of the five sea cucumber species noted during the survey , only  Holothuria atra  and Pearsonothuria graeffei  occurred within the shallow and deep subtidal Family Species Echinodermata (Asteroidea) Acanthasteridae Acanthaster planci Echinodermata (Holothuroidea) Holothuriidae Bohadscia argus* Holothuria atraPearsonothuria graeffei S tichopodidae Stichopus chloronotus*Thelenota ananas* Mollusca (Gastropoda) Bursidae Bursa bubo* Conidae Conus lividus Cypraeacidae Cypraea tigris S trombidae Chiragra chiragra*Strombus luhuanus Trochidae Tectus pyramis T rochus niloticus Turbinidae Turbo chrysostomus Mollusca (Bivalvia) Tridacnidae Hipoppus porcellanusTridacna crocea T . maxima T . squamosa* *Noted outside the transect Table 1.

The two largest sea cucumbers found were Thelenota ananas,  each measuring 60 cm in length. The mean sizes of other species ranged between 24and 33 cm (Fig. 2,  Table 4). Among the four giant clam species, only  Tridacna cr ocea  consistently occurred in seven sites (T able 2) with declining abundance as depth of habitat increased (T able 3). For other tridacnid species, abundance was very low (T ables 2 and 3).  The average (± sd) shell length of  T. cr ocea  was 7.19±4.32 cm, while the Hippopus por cellanus measured 28.85±6.91 cm, and the  Tridacna maxima  was 13.12±5.64 cm (Figure 3). Among the reef gastropods, only  Trochus niloticus occured in all seven sampling sites, mainly concentrating in the shallow subtidal habitats (~1.0 m deep during low tide) of Sites 1 and 2 (T ables 2 and 3). The not-socommon trochid species  Tectus  pyramis  appeared to favor deeper habitats. There was a high number of S tr ombus luhuanus  in the intertidal area of Site 6 (T able Figure 2.

All sizes were shell lengths except for maximum basal diameter for  T. niloticus  and T. pyramis. Common macrobenthic reef invertebrates of Tubbataha5 Science Diliman  (July-December 2012)  24:2, 1-11 2). In terms of average size (±sd), T. niloticus  measured (8.2±1.6 cm) while  T. pyramis  was about 4.8±1.1 cm in diameter . The sizes of other mollusks species are shown in Figure 3. DISCUSSION The limited number of species encountered in this study could be site-related.   Transects were established in rocky areas suitable for the trochid species, but possiblynot for others. The surveyed sites were only at the seaward reef flat and slope and did not include other important habitats within the lagoon. Sea cucumbers generally favor sandy-muddy grounds with rubble (Conand 1998, Schoppe 2000) instead of seaward rocky habitats, which are preferred by the trochus (Nash 1993). Some species are nocturnal (Kerr and others 2006) making them dif ficult to spot during the day . There are over 170 sea cucumber species in thePhilippines (see Olavides and others 2010), thus further surveys on other potential habitats within the park may yield additional species. All five sea cucumber species recorded in TRNP are harvested and sold as  bêche-de-mer with varying demands (Conand 1998,  Akamine 2002, Olavides and others 2010).  Among these five species, Pearsonothuria graeffei  is of pharmacological importance because it contains substances with anti-cancer properties (Zhao and others 201 1). However, the indiscriminate harvesting of sea cucumbers hascaused their populations to decline, forcing fishermen to venture to deeper and offshore reefs (Anderson and others 201 1), which may include  marine protected areas (Choo 2008). T o date, all the seven giant clam species in the Philippines have been recorded in the  TRNP. Species of giant clams noted during the survey include:  Tridacna cr ocea, T ridacna maxima, T ridacna squamosa,  and Hippopus por cellanus. In 2009,  Tridacna derasa  and empty shells of the  Tridacna gigas  were noted (Dolorosa unpublished data) and the presence of the Hippopus hippopus  has been previously reported (Y amaguchi 1996, Dolorosa and Schoppe 2005). However , it can be that the finding of the  H. hippopus was a misidentification of  H. porcellanus  (Fig. 4), although the possibility that these two species can co- exist cannot be disregarded. The densities of commonly encountered macrobenthic reef invertebrates in the TRNP appear to vary among sampling sites and depths. Considerable numbers of the  A. planci  in the deep subtidal (~5 m) reef slope of Sites 1 and 4, with densities at 28 and 37 ind/200 m 2 , can be  noted. These species can be seen aggregating, Figure 4. The  Hippopus porcellanus  in Tubbat aha Reefs Natural Park. Note the fringing tent acles on the inhalant siphon (left) and the shell that is globose in shape and semicircular in outline with  smooth and regularly shaped dorsal margin (right) . Dolorosa, R.G. and Jontila, J.B.S. 6 Science Diliman (July-December 2012)  24:2, 1-11 often on top of each other , while actively feeding during the day.  As early as 2007,   A. planci had been commonly sighted in some reefs within the TRNP and in many reef areas in the mainland Palawan (pers. obs.). In 2008, researchers collected more than 3,000 individual COT s in the Northwestern part of the North Atoll, which measures about 2 h (Ledesma and others2008). In the Great Barrier Reef, outbreaks of COT s have been thought to be a natural phenomenon but havealso been linked with the overexploitation of their predators and the influx of nutrients (Harriott and others 2003). In  TRNP, the reported COT s predators, such as the giant reef gastropods  Charonia tritonis  and Cassis cornuta , were not noted during the survey , but in January 2010, two  C. tritonis on the reef slope and six  C. cornuta  partly buried in exposed sand during low tides (Dolorosa unpublished data) were noted,suggesting a variation in habitats between the two species. The densities of sea cucumbers in the TRNP are quite low compared with some reported densities in the Pacific (see Conand 1998), but their sizes appear larger or comparable with the maximum and common sizes (T able 4) as reported by Conand (1998) and Kerr and others (2006). Shiell (2004) and Eriksson (2012) reportthat adult and juvenile sea cucumbers have separate distinct habitats; this survey was only conducted at the seaward reefs, which could be one of the reasons for having low densities and limited but large-sized samples. The density of  T. cr ocea , which declined with depth, could also be substrate and site related. In an inner reef surrounding the Ranger S tation of the TRNP, high numbers of  T. cr ocea  aggregated in coral heads, exposed at low tide (pers. obs.), make this area a potential monitoring site for the said species. Hammer and Jones (1976) show that the density of the  T. cr ocea on top and underside of coral boulders varies withdistance from the shore, writing that the highest density occurs at habitats 140 m (24.1 ind m -2 ) from shore compared with those found at 90 m (7.6 ind m -2 ) and 160 m (14.4 ind m -2 ) from shore. In the  TRNP, the
density of the giant clam  T. cr ocea  is higher than reported densities from other parts of the country and in many areas in the Pacific (see Othman and others 2010). Based on the previous studies conducted in the Park, it appears that the population of T. cr ocea  has declined considerably from 440 ind/200 m 2 in 1993 to 200 ind/200 m 2 in 1995, down to 27 ind/200 m 2 in 2005 (see Dolorosa  and Schoppe 2005). These figuresprovide a snapshot of information on the general status of the species in the  TRNP.  However , sites covered by each survey differ and results cannot be compareddirectly and would be insufficient to say that population of  T. cr ocea  has indeed declined over the years.  To have a reliable data trend, there should be arepresentative number of sites and regular monitoring over the years.  Data should be site-specific rather than generalized, for it is important to take into account the inherent differences of each site. The density of  Tridacna maxima  in some sites at the TRNP is much higher than the reported densities from other parts of the country (Othman and others 2010), but comparable with the densities in fished (0.6 ind/ 200 m 2 ) and unfished (0.8 ind/200 m 2 ) reefs in the Maldives (Basker 1991).  The T. maxima , however , can reach an extremely high density of 88.3 million clams in 1 1.46 km -2
 (Gilbert and others 2006), equivalent to
 1,541 ind/200 m -2
 . In the Reao  Atoll, the density can be
 as high as 244 ind m -2
 or 48,800 ind/200 m -2
 (Salvat
 1971 in Gilbert and others 2006). Conversely , the
 Hippopus por cellanus appears to be very rare in the
 Philippines as its density is only reported in El Nido, Palawan at 0.0008 ind/200 m 2
 (see Othman and others
 2010). However , the high number of  H. porcellanus
 in Site 6 indicates a recovering population. It may also suggest that it is not a current target species compared to trochus whose population declined sharply in Site 6 due to poaching (Dolorosa and others 2010, Jontila and others 201 1). The mean sizes of tridacnid species recorded in the  TRNP, which were much smaller than their common sizes as reported by Poutiers (1998a), also suggest that most individuals have yet to reach their maximum sizes. The locally threatened reef gastropod  T. niloticus  (DA 2001) in the TRNP had its mean density in 2006 (about 6,000 ind ha -1 ) (Dolorosa and others 2010) reduced to 1,714 ind ha -1 or 34 ind/200 m 2
 in only two years of
 exploitation (Jontila and others 201 1). Results of this

 study further show that only sites close to the Ranger Station (Sites 1 and 2) contained considerable populations (T able 2). Despite this, the population of trochus in the TRNP is exceptionally higher than atany other sites in the country (see Dolorosa and others 2010) and even in some Pacific Islands (Smith and others 2002, Lasi 2010).  Conversely , the mean size of trochus  (82 mm) is smaller than in the Cartier Reef (Smith and others 2002), in  Tongavera, Cook Islands (Chambers 2007), and in  Aitutaki (Ponia and others 1997).  The other trochid species  Tectus pyramis  appear
 to prefer deeper areas although few individuals occurin the intertidal and shallow subtidal sites. Its average density (2 ind/200 m 2 ) and size (4.8±1.1 cm) are comparable with the previous report (2.38 ind/200 m 2 ; 4.7±0.5 cm) of Dolorosa and others (2010), suggesting the absence of exploitation. Unlike the trochus, the shells of  T. pyramis  have low commmercial value (Gillespie 1997) and their inclusion in the confiscated trochuscollected by poachers from the TRNP in 2007 (Dolorosa and others 2010) is rather accidental and because the poaching happened at night. The other invertebrates in the TRNP are sparsely distributed with no distinct pattern, oftentimes noted inintertidal and shallow subtidal sites. It is only  Str ombus luhuanus  that has a considerable number recorded in the intertidal areas of Site 6 (70 ind/200 m 2 ) and fewer in the intertidal and deep areas of Site 5. The speciesseems not at all exploited because of its small size or may have quickly recovered given the similarities in mean sizes between the recent (Fig. 3) and previous studies.   Yamaguchi (1996) reports an average size of 5.03 cm, while a common size of 5 cm is reported byPoutiers (1998b). Aside from the possible effects of harvesting, the low numbers of macrobenthic reef invertebrates might be related to slow recovery . Overfishing of sea cucumbers (Uthicke and Conand 2005) and giant clams (Gomezand Mingoa-Licuanan 2006, Othman and others 2010) are common problems in the Philippines and in most parts of their habitat range. Once overfished, these organisms are difficult to revive because of their large size, slow growth, mode of reproduction (broadcast spawner), low fecundity , and late maturity (Bruckner 2006, Anderson and others 201 1). It is important to note that prior to having been declared as a NationalPark in 1988, the  Tubbataha Reefs had already been overexploited (Arquiza and  White 1999) and possibly, many slow growing reef species (e.g.  T. gigas ) are
 still in the process of recovering. It is estimated thatafter harvesting closure, decades are required for sea cucumber populations to recover; recovery for other large macro invertebrates require a much longer time (see  Anderson and others 201 1).
 T o fully understand the status of sea cucumbers, giant
 clams, and other important reef invertebrates likecrustaceans, there is a need to establish separate survey sites for each species for regular monitoring. Assessment is suggested in areas dominated by sand, rubble, and sea grass at the seaward and leeward parts of the South and North  Atolls. Different survey methods (e.g. traps) may be needed to study thecrustacean resources in the  TRNP.
 The  TRNP  is among the few MP As in the country
 where protection and management really work. Overtwo decades of protection has made the fish population steadily increase and coral cover recovery relatively stable (Dygico 2006, Ledesma and others 2008). Fish population may be overwhelming but other resources, such as macrobenthic invertebrates, may already be dwindling as with the  T. niloticus .  The  lar ge scale extraction of reef invertebrates (Arquiza and White1999) particularly giant clams (T icke 2002, BenaventeV illena and Pido 2004) in the early 2000s could have seriously affected their populations, especially those of the  T. squamosa  and the T. gigas.  All giant clam species are listed in  Appendix II of CITES, suggesting that “these species are not necessarily threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade so closely controlled” (CITES 2013). However , separate populations of species may have different conservationneeds as some species may have become extinct in other areas (IUCN 2012).  As the TRNP serves as a seed source for the heavily depleted reefs in mainlandPalawan and the surrounding reef areas within the Sulu Sea (see  White and  Vogt 2000), the protection of the remaining populations of these reef invertebrates andother marine organisms in TRNP is deemed important.

Introduction        
The  Philippines  is  a  culturally  diverse    
country  with  an  estimated  12    –15  million    
indigenous  people  (IPs)  belonging  to  110   
ethno   -linguistic  groups  (  Waddington  2002    ).  
The     indigenous  people  constitute  10  –15 %    of     
the  population  of  the    country .  They  are     mainly     
found    in  Northern  Luzon  and  Mindanao,  with  
some groups in the Visayas area (UNDP 2010). 
Among  the  major  group    s of    IPs  are  the  Igorot   
of  Northern  Luzon,  the  Lumads  of  Mindanao, 
the     Mangyans  of  Mindoro,  and  the  Negritos  
living  in  different  regions   of  the  country   . The   
Negritos     migrated  from  mainland   Asia     and        
settle  d  in    the  Philippines  around  30,000  years    
ago  (  Cariño   20 10  ).  Their   main    tribal  groups  
include  the    Ati  found  in  Panay   , the  Agta  in     
Bicol, and the  Aeta     in Luzon   .   
The  Aetas   of  Luzon   are  nomadic   
people.  Their  social  activities  revolve  around 
hunting  of  birds,  f  rogs,  and  other  animals,  and    
gathering  of  fruits,  insects,  and  mushrooms 
(Shimizu  1989).        Mushrooms  also  provide    
additional  incomes  to  households  if  sold  in

(1) Floridablanca,  Pampanga:       
Site 1: Brgy. Mawacat ( 14° 58' 26 N, 120° 26' 9 E,    AD), Aeta population is 1,500.         
Site 2: Brgy. Nabuclod (    15° 1' 1 N, 120° 26' 36 E,     RA), Aeta population is 620.       
The Aeta sub    -tribe living in this province are the Mag  -indi.      
(2) Capas, Tarlac   :   
Site 1: Brgy. Yeyoung ( 15° 19' 32 N, 120° 25' 1 E,    AD), Aeta population is 396.       
Site 2: Brgy. Kalangitan (  15° 18' 46 N, 120° 31' 11 E,   RA), Aeta population is 2,940.         
The sub -tribe of the Aetas in this province are the Mag    -antsi.     
(3) Botolan, Zamba  les:        
Site 1: Brgy. Bucao (   15° 15' 28 N, 120° 1' 51 E    , AD), Aeta population is 1,570.        
Site     2:     Brgy. Bihawo (  15° 19' 8 N, 120° 2' 46 E , RA), Aeta population is 1,020.        
Aeta communities in this province belong to the sub -tribe Zambal   .   
 
 
regional  mark  ets  (Yongabi  et  al.  2004).  In  the     
Philippines,  IPs  were  known  to  utilize 
macrofungi  species  for  various  purposes 
(Tayamen  et  al.  2004).  However,  few 
published  reports  document  the  exact  number 
of  macrofungi  utilized  by  these  communities. 
Hence,  their  indig    enous  knowledge  is  poorly    
documented and not systematically recorded. It 
is  therefore  of  urgency  to  properly  document 
this  traditional  knowledge  before  it  is  lost. 
Thus,  our  study  surveyed  and  documented  the 
utilization  of  macrofungi  by  six  Aeta 
communitie  s  in  selected  areas  of  Central     
Luzon.      
 
Methods     
 
Study Sites     
Six  sites  in  three  provinces  (Pampanga,    
Tarlac  and  Zambales)  in  Central  Luzon,     
Northern  Philippines  served  as  the  study  sites 
(Fig.  1).  In  each  province,  one  of  the  study 
communities  surveyed  was   Aeta  tribe  in  their     
ancestral  domain  (AD)  while  the  other  tribe 
was  in  a  resettlement  area  (RA).  Those  in  the 
resettlement  areas  were  Aetas  displaced  by  the 
eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991.       
 
The respondents     
The Aetas are the earliest inhabitants of   
the     Philippines.  Their  estimated  population  is  
around  140,500  individuals.  In  Central  Luzon, 
they  dwell  mainly  on  mountain  slopes  in  the 
provinces  of  Bataan,  Nueva  Ecija,  Pampanga, 
Tarlac,  and  Zambales.  Many  of  the  Aetas 
living  in  Nueva  Ecija  and  some  towns  in      
Pampanga,  Tarlac  and  Zambales  previously 
lived  on  the  slopes  of  Mt.  Pinatubo  but  were        
now  in  resettlement  areas.  They  regarded  the 
mountain,  as  the  home  of  their  supreme  deity,

Apo  Namalyari.  The  Aetas  are  divided  into 
seven  sub  -tribes  according  to  their  dialect.     
These  are:  (1)  Mag   -Indi  (Pampanga),  (2)  Mag    -   
Antsi  (Tarlac),  (3)  Zambal  (Zamba   les)  (4)   
Ambala  (Bataan),  (5)  Kabayukan  (Bataan),  (6) 
Kaunana  (Bataan),  and  (7)  Magbekin  or 
Magbukon (Bataan).      
    
Survey Questionnaire and Interview      
Initially,  a  letter  was  given  to the  tribal   
heads  in  the  study  sites  requesting  permission 
to conduct researc  h in their areas. A permit was  
also secured from the National  Commission on 
Indigenous  People  (NCIP)  of  the  Republic  of 
the  Philippines.  A  meeting  was  then  held  with 
the  tribal  heads  and  elders  in  each  of  the  Aeta 
communities  for  the  conduct  of  the  survey 
questionnaires and interview.       
Information  asked  in  the  questionnaires     
included:  socio    -demographic  data,  knowledge  
on  mushrooms,  and  beliefs  and  practices  on 
mushroom  collection  and  cultivation.  The 
survey  questionnaires  were  given  to  30 
respondents per st  udy site (aged 16 and above).   
Formatted  interviews  of  the  tribal  chieftains 
and other elders were also done to gather more 
data  on  the  mushrooms  they  utilized  and  their 
traditions.  During  the  collection  of  specimens, 
the tribal  heads and other  members of t   he tribe    
including  a  representative  from  NCIP  joined 
the  field  collection  and  provided  additional 
information.        
    
Collection and Identification of Specimens      
All  visibly  present  macrofungi  utilized     
by the Aeta communities were collected during 
the  rainy  sea son  (from  May  to  October  2011)     
with  the  assistance  of  the  tribal  chieftains  and 
other  tribe  members.  Specimens  were  initially 
photographed  in  their  habitat,  collected  and 
placed  in  bags, then taken to the  laboratory  for 
identification.  For  fleshy  specimens ,  samples  
were  preserved  in  95%  ethanol.  Other 
specimens,  particularly  the  polypore  fungi, 
were  air   -dried  and  prepared  as  herbarium    
specimens.  Fruiting  body  morphologies 
including  cap  size,  cap  description,  etc.  were 
determined  for  each  of  the  specimens.  A    spore  
print  was  made  from  fleshy  mushrooms  while 
sectioning  was  done  for  non -fleshy     
mushrooms.  Identification  was  made  by   
comparing  morphologies  with  published 
literature,  e.g.,  Quimio  (2001),  Lodge  et  al.     
(2004).         
 
Data analysis       
The  socio  -demographic  pr    ofiles  of  the     
respondents  in  the  six  Aeta  communities  were 
tabulated  to  provide  basic  information  on  the 
respondents.  The  number  of  identified  fungi 
recorded  in  the  survey  questionnaire  was 
determined  for  each  of  the  sub -tribes.  The   
mushrooms reported in t he questionnaires were  
correlated  or  compared  with  the  collected 
specimens. A list of the different fungal species 
and  their  local  names  and  utilization  was 
prepared from the study.        
 
Results and Discussion      
 
Socio   -demographic profiles       
Most  of  the  Aeta  resp   ondents  were  26   -   
45  years  old,  female,  married  and  with 
Catholicism  as  their  main  religion  (Table  1). 
This  is  also  true  with  most  of  the  IPs  found  in 
Northern  Luzon     (Cabauatan  2008).   Many  of   
the  respondents  also  reached  only  elementary 
level  in  their  educat    ion.  This  was  attributed  to     
poverty.  The  situation  is  also  very  similar  with 
most of the IPs in the Philippines (NCIP 2009).     
 
Indigenous  Knowledge  on  Mushrooms  and 
their Utilization       
Most  of  the  Aeta  respondents,   
regardless  of  their  tribal  affiliation  and  p  resent  
settlement area, knew about mushrooms (Table 
2).  All  sub   -tribes  believed  that  mushrooms  
appear  when  it  rained.  However,  three  sub -   
tribes,  i.e.  the  Mag -Indi  in  Brgy.  Mawacat,  
Pampanga, the Mag   -Antsi  in Brgy. Kalangitan,    
Tarlac,  and  the  Zambal  in  Brgy .  Bihawo,  
Zambales,  believed  that  mushrooms  appear 
also  during  the  cold  months  (December  –   
January)  and/or  hot  months  (March   –April).    
This observation was supported by   Reyes et al.    
(2003)      wherein  mushrooms  could  grow     
anytime  of  the  year  in  the  Philippines  as    long    
as  present or  growing  in  moist  areas   .  Tayamen  
et al. (2004) noted that some species grew only     
after  heavy  downfall.  The  Aeta   respondents    
believed  that  mushrooms  grow  in  soil, 
decaying  logs,  and  leaf  litter  (Table  2).

Th  e  Aetas  collect  mushrooms  mainly    
for  food  and  rarely  for  medicine  and  other 
purposes  (Table  2).  The  cooking  method 
preferred  by  the  Aetas  for  nearly  all  edible 
mushrooms  were  sautéed  or  boiled  with  other 
vegetables  and  fermented  fish  sauce. 
Unfortunately,  there  are  no  other  reported     
researches  on  the  ethnomycology  of  other  IPs 
in  the  Philippines  so  our  result  cannot  be 
compared  to  see  if  other  IPs  also     shares   the    
same  beliefs.  In  Guyana,  the  cooking  method 
preferred  by  the  Patamona  indigenous  tribe 
was stea    ming the mushroom in leaves collected   
in the forests (Henkel et al. 2004).        
 
Listing of Mushrooms Utilized by the Aetas      
There  were     38   records  of  macrofungi    
that  are  utilized  by  the  different  Aeta   sub -   
tribes:     21   fungal  records  in  Pampanga,     10   in     
Tarlac,  and        19      in  Zambales  (Table  3).

Mycosphere Doi 10.5943/mycosphere/3/2/  9

However,  during  the  entire  duration  of  the 
mushroom  collection  from  May  to  October 
2011, only 14 fungal species were encountered, 
collected  and  identified  (Table  3).     Twelve      
species  were  utilized  as  food:  Auricularia     
auricula,  A.   polytricha,  Calvatia   sp  ., Lentinus     
tigrinus,  L.  sajor    -caju,  Pleurotus   sp  .,  Schizo  -   
phyllum  commune,  Termitomyces  clypeatus,  T.     
robustus,   two  species  of     Termitomyces,  and     
Volvariella volvacea    (Table 4).      
IPs  from  the  African  continent  eat     
about  300  species  of  fungi  (Rammeloo  &    
Walleyn  1993).  Fungal  species  were  also  used 
by  indigenous  people  as  food  in  Mexico 
(Garibay    -Orijel  et  al.  2006,  Montoya  et  al.   
2004),  Malaysia  (Christensen  &  Larsen  2005), 
and  Papua  New  Guinea  (Sillitoe  1995).   In     
Africa,  various  kinds  o  f  wild  edible     
mushrooms  were  found  ,  of  which     15  to  25     
species  were  locally  well     known  and  eaten  
throughout  Zambia  (Pegler  &  Pierce  1980). 
Many of these were also sold  in  market places.        
For  example,   Auricularia  polytricha  is  consu  -   
med  in  many  African  region  s,  more  particu   -   
larly  in    Nigeria.  Other  species  of  edible   
mushrooms  found  in  Africa  included  Agrocybe    
spp.,   Boletus     spp.,   Canthareullus   spp.,   Calvatia        
spp.,   Coprinus     sp p., Lactaricus  kabansus    , L.    
inversus    , L.  piperatus , L.  edulis    , Lentinus   cla    -   
dopus   ,   L.  sq  uarosulus   ,   L.  tuber   -regium ,   
Macrolepiota  procera   , M.  zeyheri   , Pleurotus     
squarrosulus    ,   Psathyrella  atroumbonata,  P.  
candolleana,  Russula   spp .,  Schizophyllum   
commune,  Terfezia  boudieri,  T.  claveryi,  T. 
pfeilii,  Termitomyces  microcarpus,  T.  clypea    -   
tus,  T.  shi   mperi,  T.  titanicus,  T.  auratiacus,  T.     
globu   -lus, T. eurhizus, T. robustus, Tricholoma  
loba    -yense, T. matsutake, Volvariella volvacea,     
V.  esculenta   ,    and    V.  speciosa     (Labarere  &   
Gemini  2000).  Of  these   ,   A.  polytricha,  S.     
commune,  T.  clypeatus,  T.  robustus  , and   V.  
volvacea        were  also  reported  as  edible    
mushrooms  by  the  Aeta  communities  (Table 
4).     
In  Zambales,  one  sub -tribe  (Zambal)    
reported that   Ganoderma lucidum    was used for   
house decoration while  in Pampanga, a species 
of  Mycena   was  used  as  medicine  by     the  s ub  -   
tribe  Mag  -Indi  (Table  5    ).  In  Germany,  a  new    
metabolite  extracted  from     Mycena   sp.  was   
found  to  be  active  against  bacteria  and  fungi    
(Sheldrik  1990).   Ganoderma  lucidum  ,  on  the  
other  hand,  is  utilized  mostly  as  medicine  and 
no  previous  research  cites  its  u   se  as  a   
household decoration.       
Twenty  -one  local  names  for  several    
mushroom  species  were  used  by  sub  -tribe  
Mag -Indi,  10  by  sub -tribe  Mag -Antsi,  and  19    
by  sub -tribe  Zambal  (Table  3).  However,  all  
mushrooms are generally known as “kuwat” by 
all  Aeta sub   -tribes  and thus, names  for specific  
species of mushrooms always have this term as 
a prefix.       
Interestingly,  we  observed  similarities  
in  local  names  given  to  mushrooms  (Table  4). 
For example,    Termitomyces     sp. 1, which grows     
only  in  May,  was  locally  called  by  all    the  sub   -   
tribes  as  “kuwat  mayo”.  “Mayo”  is  the  local 
term for the month of May. It is also interesting 
to note that the different Aeta communities also 
used  different  local  names  for  similar  species 
of mushrooms (Table 4). For example, the sub    -   
tribe  Zambal    from  Zambales  used  “kuwat   
gilatgilatan”  as  local  name  for     Termitomyces        
clypeatus.   On  the  other  hand,  sub -tribe  Mag -   
Indi  from  Pampanga  used  “kuwat  uong”  while 
sub -tribe  Mag -Antsi  from  Tarlac  used  “kuwat  
kuyog”  as  the  local  name  for  this  fungal 
species.  The   y  also  used  same  local  names  for  
different  species  of  mushrooms,  e.g.        
Termitomyces    sp  . 2 and     Termitomyces     robustus       
were  both  locally  called  “kuwat  malakamay  or 
kuwat  malakamawey”  by  sub    -tribes  Mag    -Indi   
(Pampanga)  and  Zambal  (Zambales)  (Table  4).        
This  nami  ng  of  mushrooms  by  the  Aeta    
communities  was  based  on  the  substrates 
where  the  mushrooms  were  actually  found    .   
Similarly,  the  Igala  people  of  Nigera  named 
mushrooms  according  to  its  features  and  the 
substrates where they are found (Ayodele et al. 
2011).  In  o   ur  study,  Lentinus  sajor -caju    is     
known  as  “kuwat  kawayan”  since  it  is  found 
growing  in  bamboo (   Bambusa vulgaris    ). In the   
Philippines,  “kawayan”  is  the  local  name  for 
this  species of  bamboo. At this time  we cannot 
say  the  number  of  mushrooms  utilized  by  the      
Aeta  communities  until  specimens  for  the 
locally  given  names  are  all  collected  and 
accounted    for,  which  may  take  several  years.    
However,  our  study  provides      baseline    
information  on  the  species  of  mushrooms 
utilized by the Aeta tribes.

The  number  of  species  utilized  by  
different   Aeta    tribe   s varies     in  relation  to  their    
residential  sites   (Table     5).  It  is  interesting  to    
note  that   the  mushrooms  utilized  b    y  the  Aeta    
communities     in  their  ancestral  domain    s  we   re  
also    utilized  by  the   sub -tribes  who     now  live  in  
the resettlement areas.  This shows that the sub    -   
tribes  that  resettled  in  different  communities 
other  than  their  ancestral  domains  still  observe 
their  customs  and  beliefs  on  mushrooms  and 
utilized  the  same  species    of  mushrooms  they     
once  used  in  their  ancestral  homes.  Their 
utilization  of  these  species  remained  the  same. 
For example,    T. clypeatus     was used as  food by   
all  three  sub -tribes  living  in  their  ancestral   
domains.  The  same  species  were  also  used  as 
food  by  oth   er  sub -tribes  presently  living  in  the     
resettlement areas.     
 
Indigenous  Beliefs  on  Mushroom 
Cultivation and Utilization     
The  different  Aeta  sub   -tribes  are  also  
governed  by  different  indigenous  beliefs  when 
it  comes  to  mushroom  collection,  utilization,      
and  cu ltivation.  Some  of  their     indigenous  
knowledge was as follows:       
(1) They do not cook mushrooms together with 
yellow  or  red  vegetables  or  with  shrimps,  fish, 
and  snails  as  eating  these  cooked  food  could 
cause fatal sickness.       
(2)  One  large  mushroom  species  i   dentified   
only as belonging to the genus  Termitomyces     is     
believed  to  be  guarded  by  supernatural  beings. 
Thus,  before  collecting    this  mushroom,  sub   -   
tribe Mag   -Indi performs dancing rituals or asks  
permission  from  the  spirits  and  kisses  the 
ground.         
(3)  Sub    -tribe  Zambal  simply  thanks  their  local    
deity  “Apo  Namalyari”  for  the  abundance  of 
their collected mushrooms.      
(4)  Sub    -tribe  Mag -Antsi  in  Tarlac  forbids     
combing  their  hair  and  singing  while  cooking 
mushrooms.  They  believed  this  could  attract 
lightning to str    ike the person.     
(5)  Sub    -tribe  Zambal  also  mentioned  that  they     
should  not  observe  the  development  of 
mushrooms  on  the  ground  as  the  mushroom 
will not continue to grow.      
(6)  Interestingly,  all  Aeta  sub -tribes  believed   
that spontaneous lightning causes the gro   wth of  
mushrooms.  Such  a  belief  was  also  known  in   
Japanese  farming  folklore  (Ryall,  2010).  In 
fact,  researchers  in  northern  Japan  bombarded 
a  variety  of  mushrooms  in  lab  -based  garden  
plots with artificially induced lightning to see if 
electricity  actually   makes  the  fungi  multiply     
(Ryall, 2010).      
(7)  The  Aeta  sub -tribes  also  believed  that   
mushrooms grow where the water used to wash 
or  clean  mushrooms  was  thrown.  This  is 
expected since  mushroom spores present in the 
washed  water  would  germinate  and  form 
fruiti  ng bodies.      
In  summary,    38  macrofungi  were    
recorded  by  the  six  Aeta  sub   -tribes  in     
Pampanga,  Tarlac  and  Zambales.  Only  14 
species  of  these  reported  mushrooms  were 
collected  and  identified.  The  Aeta  sub -tribes     
used  these  mushrooms  as  food,  as  medicine  or 
as h    ousehold decoration.        
Interestingly,  the  Aetas  used  similar   
common  names  for  different  species  of 
mushrooms  since  naming  of  the  species  was 
based  on  their  substrates.  All  sub -tribes  used   
the same species of  mushrooms when  living  in 
their  ancestral  homes  or     in  resettlement  areas.    
Our  study  highlighted  the  importance  of 
enthnomycological  studies  in  preserving  the 
indigenous  knowledge  of  our  indigenous 
people.

  INTRODUCTION 
Many  studies  have  shown  that  changes  in  land  cover  due  to 
anthropogenic  activities  have  negative  impacts  on  the 
hydrological  and  hydraulic  processes  in  river  basins  and 
watersheds (Matheussen et al., 2009, Zope et al., 2016, Koneti et 
al., 2018). Human-induced modifications that alter the land cover 
characteristics such as deforestation, urbanization, and croplands 
expansions  can  change  how  a  river  basin  responds  to  rainfall 
(Isik  et  al.,  2008),  and  they  have  been  found  to  increase  surface 
runoff  and  peak  flows  (Koneti  et  al.,  2018,  Guzha  et  al.,  2018). 
In  most  cases,  these  changes  led  to  greater  incidence,  risk  and 
vulnerability of flooding (Bronstert et al., 2002, Gao et al., 2013, 
Tarigan,  2016,  Zope  et  al.,  2016,  Liu  and  Shi,  2017),  which 
could  bring  catastrophic  damages  to  human  lives  and  properties 
(Tran  et  al.,  2010).  Hence,  quantifying  anthropogenic  activities, 
and  assessing  and  understanding  its  impacts  to  the  hydrologic 
and  hydraulic  behaviours  of  river  basins  have  become  very 
important  nowadays  not  only  for  efficient  water  resources 
planning  and  management  (Koneti  et  al.,  2018),  but  also  for 
effective  flood  mitigation  and  disaster  managemen t 
(Petchprayoon et al., 2010, Zope et al., 2016). 
 
Studying the impacts of land cover change on flood behaviour is  considered  a  complex  and  time-consuming  process  because  the 
factors  that  determine  river  flow  and  flood  intensity,  e.g.,  land 
cover,  vary  both  spatially  and  temporally  (Petchprayoon  et  al., 
2010). However, such problems have been overcome through the 
application of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information 
System  (GIS)  technologies  together  with  hydrologic  and 
hydraulic 
models.  RS‟  capabil ity  to  provide  the  most 
fundamental information describing the nature and extent of land 
cover  especially  over  large  areas  in  an  accurate  and  timely 
manner,  together  with  GIS  as  an  efficient  tool  for  spatial  data 
analysis,  have  been  proven  to  be  effective  in  characterizing  the 
patterns,  intensity  and  dynamics  of  land  cover  change 
(Petchprayoon  et  al.,  2010, Santillan et al., 2011, Thakkar et al., 
2017).  On  the  other  hand,  hydrologic  models  (also  called 
rainfall-runoff  models)  can  be  used  to  simulate  the  hydrology  of 
the  river  basins  using  rainfall  and  land-cover  information  as 
important  inputs  (Nie  et  al.,  2011,  Santillan  et  al.,  2011).  Using 
this  model,  a  river  basin‟s  response  to  rainfall  in  the  form  of 
surface  runoff  and  peak  flows  can  be  estimated  based  on 
different  landcover  conditions,  and  the  model  outputs  (e.g.,  flow 
hydrographs) are compared to determine the impact of land cover 
change  (Santillan  et  al.,  2011).  The  flow  hydrographs  generated 
by  hydrologic  models  for  certain  land  cover  conditions  can  also 
be  used  as  inputs  into  hydraulic  models  to  dynamically  simulate ISPRS Annals  of the  Photogrammetry,  Remote Sensing  and Spatial  Information  Sciences, Volume IV-3/W1

the  movement  of  water  along  the  rivers  and  in  the  floodplains, 
thereby  generating  spatially-distributed  flood  depths  and  extents 
(Santillan  et  al.,  2016).  The  outputs  of  the  hydraulic  model  for 
different  land  cover  conditions  can  then  be  subjected  to  spatial 
analysis  using  GIS  to  ascertain  any  changes  in  flood  depth  and 
extent,  where  the  detected  changes,  if  there  are  any,  may  be 
attributed to changes in land cover (Zope et al., 2016). 
 
Th e Agusan River Basin (ARB) is the third largest river basin in 
the Philippines (Figure 1), with a drainage area of approximately 
10,921 km 2
, and a main tributary (Agusan River) measuring 350 
km  long  (ADB,  2008).  The  basin  is  of  great  importance  due  to 
its  socio-economic  contributions  that  include  abundant  water 
resources,  logging,  agriculture,  and  mining.  An  essential  feature 
of  the  ARB  is  the  Agusan  Marsh,  an  extensive  floodplain  in  the 
basin  where  rivers,  creeks  and  tributaries  converge  and  drain 
northward  to  the  Agusan  River  and  into  Butuan  Bay  (Primavera 
and  Tumanda  Jr.,  2008). The marsh has long been considered to 
acts as storage for rain water and reduces the downstream flow of 
flood  water  into  population  centers  situated  within  the  Agusan 
River  (Ramsar,  1999),  particularly  Butuan  City,  a  highly-
populated  and  urbanized  city  located  in  the  downstream  of  the 
basin.  However,  recent  flooding  incidents  caused  by  extreme 
rainfall  brought  about  by  tropical  storms,  low  pressure  systems, 
and  tail  end  of  a cold front that resulted to fatalities, agricultural 
and  infrastructure  damages  around  the  marsh  and  in  populated 
centers  (NDRRMC,  2014,  NDRRMC,  2017)  seem  to  suggest 
that  the marsh is no longer functioning as expected. In fact, high 
siltation  in  the  marsh  due  to  the  deforestation  and  other 
anthropogenic  activities,  particularly  mining,  in  the  watersheds 
upstream  of  the  marsh  is  a  problem  that  remains  to  be  solved 
through  the  years  (Ramsar,  1999).  Land-use  conversions  for 
agricultural  plantation  development,  particularly  rice,  oil  palm 
and banana plantation developments, have also encroached some 
of  the  river  basin‟s  natural  biodiversity  and  structure  (Varela  et 
al., 2013). 
 
With  the  increasing  presence  of  anthropogenic  activities  and 
natural  changes  occurring  within  the  ARB,  it  is  important  to 
quantify  how  such  activities  have  modified  the  basin‟s  land -cover. However, there is a current lack of studies and information 
on  the  spatial  extent  and  dynamics  of  land-cover  in  the  ARB 
through  the  years.  Therefore  it  cannot  be  ascertained  how  such 
changes  have  impacted  the  hydrologic  and  hydraulic  behaviours 
of  the  basin.  Undertaking  such  studies  is  of  tremendous 
importance  for  purposes  of  assessing the current status of basin, 
and for understanding the impacts of natural changes and human-
induced modifications to the incidence of flooding. 
 
The primary aim of this study is to analyse of the impacts of land 
cover  changes  to  the  hydrologic  and  hydraulic  behaviours  of  the 
ARB  using  an  integrated  approach  involving  RS,  GIS,  an d 
hydrologic  and  hydraulic  models.  Using  the  years  1995-2017  as 
the  period  of  analysis,  the  study  specifically  aims  to  (i)  map  the 
different land cover classes in the ARB for 1995 and 2017 using 
Landsat  images,  (ii)  detect  the  changes  in  land-cover  between 
these  years,  (iii)  simulate  the  impacts  of  the  changes  in  land-
cover  to  the  basin  runoff  and  discharges  using  a  calibrated 
hydrologic  model  based  on  HEC  HMS  under  different  extreme 
rainfall conditions, and (iv) simulate the impact of the changes in 
land-cover  to  flood  depth  and  extent  using  a  hydraulic  model 
based  on  the HEC-RAS (River Analysis System) under different 
extreme  rainfall  conditions.  The  year  1995  was  considered  the 
baseline  data  for  the  analysis  as  it  can  represent  the  state  of  the 
ARB  prior  to  the  implementation  of  many  government  laws  and 
programs  such  as  the  Mining  Act  of  1995  and  the  National 
Greening Program in 2011. 
 
2.  METHODS AND MATERIALS 
2.1 The Study Area 
The  analysis  is  particularly  focused  on  how  much  change  has 
occurred in the portions of the ARB that are upstream of Butuan 
City (specifically in the upstream of “Dankias Station” as shown 
in  Figure  1),  and  how  much  discharge  is  generated  in  the 
upstream  that  flows  in  the  Agusan  River  towards  Butuan  City 
and  Butuan  Bay  for  the  two  land  cover  conditions  and  for 
different  extreme  rainfall  conditions.    For  this  study,  the 
boundary  of  the  ARB  was  delineated  from  a  10-m  DEM  using 
watershed  delineation  tools  available  in  ArcGIS  10.2  software. 
This  DEM,  which  was  provided  by  the  DREAM Program  of the 
University  of  the  Philippines-Diliman,  was  generated  from 
RADARSAT-2  data  gathered  during  2012-2013   (Ramirez, 
2014).  The  delineated  boundary  of  the  ARB  with  its  outlet 
located in Butuan Bay has an area of  12,079  km2
 which is larger 
than  the  reported  drainage  area  of  10,921  km 2
.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  area  of  the  ARB  upstream  of  Dankias  Station  is 
approximately 11,523  km2
. 
  
2.2 Land cover mapping and change detection 
 
2.2.1 Landsat images:  The land-cover maps for 1995 and 2017 
with  30-m  spatial  resolutions  were  generated  using  a  total  of  23 
Landsat  images  under  path  112  and  rows  54  and  55  of  the 
Worldwide  Reference  System  (WRS)  where  the  ARB  is  entirely 
contained.  Processing  such  number  of  images  was  necessary  in 
order  address  the  problem  of  cloud  cover  in  all  available images 
of  the  study  area,  thereby  allowing  to  substitute  or  composite 
areas  having  cloud  cover  (Toure  et  al.,  2018 ).  All  images  were 
downloaded as Standard Terrain Correction L1TP products from 
the  United  States  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  Earth  Explorer 
website  ( http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ ).   Of  these,  13  images 
acquired  by  Landsat  5  Thematic  Mapper  (TM)  were  utilized  for  Figure 1. The Agusan River Basin.  ISPRS Annals  of the  Photogrammetry,  Remote Sensing  and Spatial  Information  Sciences, Volume IV-3/W1

Landsat  8  Operational  Land  Imager  (OLI)  were  utilized  to 
generate the 2017 land cover map.  
 
For the 1995 land cover mapping, two Landsat 5 TM images (in 
rows 54 and 55)  acquired on April 12, 1995 have the least cloud 
cover  and  were  utilized  as  the  main  source  for  land-cover 
mapping  of  the  entire  ARB.  Missing  land  cover  information  in 
these  images  were  substituted  using  information  derived  from 
Landsat  5  TM  images  acquired  on  May  30,  October  5,  October 
12,  1995.  Some missing data portions that cannot be substituted 
using  row  54  and  55  1995  images  were  supplemented  using 
images acquired o n November 3, 1994 a nd September 21, 1996. 
In  a  similar  manner,  the  main  source  of  land  cover  information 
for  2017  was  derived  from  two  Landsat  8  OLI  images  acquired 
on  August 30 (row 54) and July 13 (row 55), 2017 . Missing data 
was  supplemented  using  images  acquired  on  March  23,  April  8, 
April  24,  May  26,  June  27,  July  13,  July  29,  and  August  30, all 
in the year 2017. 
 
The geometric accuracies and co-registrations of the images wer e 
checked using at least 9 ground control points for each image and 
using the path 112, row 54 image acquired on April 12, 1995 as 
the  base  image.  All  images  were  found  to  be  consistently  co-
registered  to  the  base  image,  with  global  Root  Mean  Square 
Errors  (RMSEs)  less  than  half  of  a  pixel .   All  the  images  were 
then  subjected  to  radiometric  calibration  (to  generate  at-sensor 
radiance  images)  and  atmospheric  correction  (using  dark  object 
subtraction  to  generate  surface  reflectance  images).  Normalized 
Difference  Vegetation  Index  (NDVI)  images  were  also  derived 
from  the  reflectance  images.  Finally,  for  each  imagery  date,  the 
reflectance  images,  NDVI  together  with  a  30-m  resolution 
Shuttle  Radar  Topography  Mission  (SRTM)  Digital  Elevation 
Model  (DEM)  were  layer-stacked  into  a  single  file  that  will  be 
used  as  input  for  image  classification.  Overall,  a  total  of  23 
layer-stacked datasets were produced. Clouds and cloud shadows 
were  manually  digitized  from  images,  and  from  it  a  mask  band 
was prepared to exclude all clouds and cloud shadows during the 
classification  stage . All  image  processing  and  subsequent 
analyses were performed using ENVI 5 software.   
 
2.2.2  Image  classification:  The  Maximum  Likelihood  (ML) 
classifier  was  used  to  independently  classify  each  of  the  layer-
stacked  image  datasets.  The  goal  of  the  classification  is  (i.)  to 
produce  land  cover  maps for assessment  of land cover change in 
th e  ARB  and  as  sources  for  land  cover-related  parameterization 
of the HEC HMS and HEC RAS models.  A classification scheme 
consist ing  of  seven  (7)  level  1  classes  (agriculture,  barren  land, 
built-up land, forest, rangeland, water, and wetland) based on the 
land  cover  and  land  use  classification  system  of  Anderson  et  al 
(1976) was initially used. Then , each level 1 class were expanded 
to  into  several  sub-classes  based  on  their  presence  in  the  ARB 
except  for  barren  land,  built-up   land,  rangeland,  and  forest 
(Table  1).  This  resulted  to  a  total  of  16  classes  for  Level  2 
classification. 
 
A  minimum  of  1000  pixels  per  class  were  selected  for  c lassifier 
training  except  for  the  “Sago  palm”  class  where only  333 pixels 
were selected for the 1995 classifications, and 504 pixels for the 
2017 classifications, due to their limited distribution in the ARB . 
These  Regions  of  Interests  (R OI)  were  collected  through  visual 
interpretation  of  the  images  which  was  made  possible  by  the 
familiarity  of  the  interpreter  with  the  study  area,  and  with  the 
help  of high resolution satellite images in Google Earth.  Various  RGB  band  combinations  were  displayed  to  facilitate  image 
interpretation  and  accurate  collection  of  training  ROIs  for  each 
class.  Prior  to  classification,  histograms  of  training  ROIs  for 
each  class  were  checked  for  normality  to  ensure  that  the  basic 
assumption of the ML is satisfied.

Only  portions  of  the  ARB  that  are  cloud  free  were  included  for 
the  classification.  Each  classification  result  was  visually 
examined,  and  post-classification  refinements  were  applied  to 
reduce  classification  errors  caused  by  the  similarities  in  spectral 
responses  of  certain  classes  (Yuan  et  al.,  2005)  such  as  barren 
land  (barren areas, exposed river beds and beaches)  and built-up 
land (i.e., barren land pixels that were classified as built-up were 
changed  as  barren  land).  For  each  covered  year,  the  individual 
results  of  the  post-classification  refinements  were  then 
mosaicked  to  create  a  Level  1  (7  classes),  and  Level  2  (16 
classes)  land  cover  maps.  The  Level  1  land  cover  maps  were 
generated  by  combining  the  appropriate  classes  in  the  Level  2 
land cover maps.

2.2.3  Classification  Accuracy  Assessment:  The  accuracies  of 
the  1995  and  2017  land  cover  maps  were  determined  using  the 
procedures  suggested  by  Congalton  (1991)  in  assessing  the 
accuracy  of  land-cover  maps  with  more  than  12  classes.  An 
independent  sample  of  100  pixels  was  randomly  selected  for 
each  class  in  the  Level 2 land cover maps (total of 1600 pixels). 
The  actual  classes  of  these  pixels  were  then  determined  by 
overlaying  in  high  resolution  Google  Earth  images,  and  through 
visual  interpretation  of  the  Landsat  images.  The  comparisons 
between  the  actual  and  classified  Level  2  land-cover  classes  for 
each  random  point  were  then  summarized  using  confusion  or 
error  matri ces. The  values  of  Overall  Classification  Accuracy, 
Producer‟s  Accuracy  and  User‟s  Accuracy  were  then  computed 
from the error matrices. 
 
2.2.4  Land  cover  change  detection:  The  1995  and  2017  land-
cover  maps  were  then  subjected  to  post-classification 
comparison change detection analysis to identify the location and 
extent  of  land-cover  change  in  the  ARB.  This  approach  can 
provide  „„from–to‟‟  change  information  and  the  kind  of 
transformations  that  have  occurred  can  be  easily  calculated  and 
mapped (Yuan et al., 2005). 
 
2.3 Hydrologic Modeling using HEC HMS 
A  hydrologic  model  based  on  the  Soil  Conservation  Service  – 
Curve  Number  (SCS-CN)  approach  was  used  to  integrate  the 
land-cover  information  derived  from  the  analysis  of  the  Landsat 
images  into  a  hydrologic  model  as  a  means  of  estimating  the 
impacts  of  the  differences  in  land  cover  conditions  to  the 
hydrological  processes  of  the  watershed  (Santillan  et  al.,  2011) , 
specifically  in  the  generation  of  runoff  under  different  extreme 
rainfall scenarios. The goal of hydrologic modeling is to estimate 
the  amount  of  runoff  generated  in  the  headwaters  of  Agusan 
River,  especially  in  the  portions  upstream  of  Dankias  Station, 
and  to  determine  the  amount  of  discharge  that  flows  into  the 
portion  of  the  river  that  traverses  Butuan  City.  The  SCS-CN 
model  computes  runoff  (Q )  from  precipitation  or  rainfall  (P ) at 
the sub-basin level using the following equations (Santillan et al., 
2011): 
     
In the above equations,  I
a (initial abstraction) includes short-term 
losses  due  to  evaporation,  interception,  surface  detention,  and 
infiltration while  S stands for potential maximum retention which 
characterizes  the  sub-basin‟s  direct  runoff  potential  (Ponce  and 
Hawkins,  1996) . S  is  directly  related  to  land  cover  and  soil 
infiltration  through  the  CN or  Curve Number which ranges from 
0-100,  depending  on  the  sub-basin‟s  antecedent  moisture 
condition  (Santillan  et  al.,  2011).  In  a  sub-basin,  CN  values  can 
vary depending on the number of combinations of land-cover and 
hydrologic  soil  group  (HSG).  Such  combination  is  called  a 
hydrologic  soil-cover  complex  (HSSC),  and  for  each  HSSC,  a 
CN  value  is  assigned  (NRCS,  2004).  For  hydrologic  modelling 
purposes,  the  CN  value  of  a  heterogeneous  sub-basin  can  be 
estimated  through  area-based  weighted  averaging  of  its  CN 
values. Table 2 shows the CN values for Level 2 land cover types 
and  hydrologic  soil  groups  under  normal  antecedent  moisture 
condition (AMCII, 5-day antecedent rainfall of 12.7 –27.94 mm).  
The AMCII CN values can be converted to AMCI (dry condition, 
AR  <  12.7  mm)  and  AMCIII  (wet  condition,  AR  >  27.94  mm)  using  appropriate  formulas  (Santillan  et  al.,  2011).  For  the 
description  of  hydrologic  soil  groups,  the  reader  is  referred  to 
NRCS (1986).  CN maps were generated for the ARB by getting 
the  union  of  the  Level-2  land-cover  maps  with  a  hydrologic  soil 
group  (HSG)  map  obtained  from  1:150,000  soil  map  of  the 
Philippines  published  by  the  Philippines‟  Bureau  of  Soils  and 
Water  Management  of  the  Department  of  Agriculture.  The  CN 
maps were later used for determining CN values at the sub-basin 
levels.

Table 2. CN values for Level 2 land cover types and hydrologic 
soil groups under normal antecedent moisture condition 
(AMCII).  
To make the modeling process complete, the SCS-CN model was 
implemented  together  with  the  Clark  Unit  Hydrograph  method 
(for  sub-basin  routing  of  runoff),  the  Exponential  Baseflow 
Recession  model,  and  the  Muskingum-Cunge  model  for  channel 
routing  using  HEC  HMS  Version  3.5.  Model  preparation  and 
parameterizations  were  performed  in  ArcGIS  10.2  using  the 
HEC -GeoHMS extension.  It was used to discretize the ARB into 
538  sub-basins  (average  area  of  22.5  km 2
),   and  to  reproduce 
topologically-correct  stream  networks  by  utilizing  the  surface 
topography information from the 10-m DEM as the origin of the 
boundaries  and  stream  network.  Similar  to  that  of Santillan et al 
(2011),  area-weighted  average  of  CN  values  were  computed  for 
each  sub-basin  based  on  the  1995  and  2017  CN  maps .   From 
this,  HEC  HMS  models  for  1995  and  for  2017  land  cover 
conditions  were  prepared.  The  2017 HEC  HMS  model  was 
calibrated  using  discharge  data  measured  at  Dankias  Station, 
together  with  rainfall  data  recorded  by  15  stations  distributed 
within  ARB.  The  calibration  data  period  is 14:00, 16 November 
2017  –  17:20,  17  November  2017.  The  calibration  includes 
adjustments  of  model  parameters  (except  the  CN)  until  the 
simulated  discharge  acceptably  match  the  measured  discharge 
data  (Santillan  et  al.,  2011).    The  Nash-Sutcliffe  Coefficient  of 
Model  Efficiency  (NSE),  percentage  bias  (PBIAS),  and  the 
RMSE -observations  Standard  Deviation  Ratio  (RSR)  were  used 
to evaluate the performance of the hydrologic model based on the  2

guidelines  of  Moriasi  et  al  (2007).  The  overall  performance  of 
the  hydrologic  model  before  calibration  was  “Unsatisfactory ” 
(NSE  =  -15.64,  PBIAS  =  -30.98,  and  RSR  =  4.08).  After  the 
calibration, the statistics improved (NSE = 0.93, PBIAS = -0.53 , 
and  RSR  =  0.27)  indicating  “Very  Good ”  model  performance. 
The  difference  between  the  simulated  and  measured  peak  flow 
was  minimal  (24.80  m 3
/s).  The  calibrated  2017  HEC  HMS 
model  parameter  values  were  used  as  the  same  values  for  the 
1995  HEC  HMS  model.    The  calibrated  models  were  then  used 
to simulate the volumes and rates of runoff and discharge (at the 
sub-basin  level  and  at  the  Dankias  Station)  under  three  24-hour 
duration  extreme  rainfall  scenarios  with  return  periods  of  5,  25 
and 100 years. The total accumulated rainfall for each scenario is 
175.2  mm  (5-year),  248.3  mm  (25-year),  and  308.6  mm  (100-
year).  These  values  were  based  on  Rainfall-Intensity  Duration 
Frequency  (RIDF)  generated  by  the  Philippine  Atmospheric 
Geophysical  and  Astronomical  Service  Administration 
(PAGASA)  based  historical  rainfall  data  recorded  at  Butuan 
City.  The  results  of  the  simulations  for  each  year  were  then 
analysed  and  checked  for  differences,  and  correlated  with  the 
changes  in  land-cover  in  the  ARB.  The  simulated  discharge 
hydrographs  at  Dankias  Stations  were  also  used  as  input  into  a 
two-dimensional (2D) HEC RAS model of Butuan City. 
 
2.4 Hydraulic Modeling using HEC RAS 
The  2D  HEC  RAS  models  for  simulating  flood  depths  and 
extents  were  developed  by  creating  a  2D  flow  area  representing 
the  entire  floodplain  of  the  ARB . The  steps  in  model 
development  are  very  similar  to  th e steps  employed  by  Santillan 
et  al  (2016).  The  2D  model  computational  domain  has  an 
approximate  area  of  368.39  km 2
,  and  consists  of  125,937  cells. 
Two  models  were  developed:  one  for  the  1995  land-cover 
condition,  and  another  for  the  2017  condition.  Both  models 
utilized  1-m  LiDAR  Digital  Terrain  Model  (DTM)  as  the 
primary  source  of  elevation  data.  The  Manning‟s  roughness 
parameters  of  the  models  were  estimated  from  the  appropriate 
Level 2 land cover maps and look-up tables available in the HEC 
RAS  Technical  Reference  Documents  (USACE,  2016) .   Each 
model consisted of 5 boundary conditions (3 inflows,  1 tidal, and 
1  boundary  condition  for  the  precipitation  that  falls  to  the  2D 
area).  The  3  inflow  conditions  consist  of  discharge  hydrographs 
simulated  by  the  HEC  HMS  models  for  Dankias  Stations  and at 
other  locations  in  the  downstream  portion  of  the  basin.  The 
simulated  flood  depths  and  extents  for  the  flood  depths  and 
extents  for  1995  and  2017  conditions  under  3  extreme  rainfall 
scenarios  were  then  compared  and  checked  for  differences. 
Similarly,  correlations  of  the  detected  changes  to  the  changes  in 
land  cover  were  also  undertaken.  Prior  to  the  simulations,  the 
accuracy  of  the  2017 model  was  determined  through  simulation 
of  the  actual  flooding  that  occurred  in  Butuan  City  last  January 
2014  during  the  occurrence  of  Tropical  Storm  “Agaton”.  The 
actual  depths  at  58  locations  were  compared  from  the  depths 
simulated  by  the  model.  In terms of simulation flooded and non-
flooded  locations,  the  model  was  found  to  have  an  overall 
accuracy  of  75.86%,  with  Root  Mean  Square  Error  (R MSE)  of 
0.23 m for the simulated flood depths. 
 
3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON 
3.1  Land-cover classification and accuracy 
The  Level  1  land  cover  classification  results  for  1995  and  2017 
(Figure  2)  have  overall  accuracies  of  93.81%  and  93.94%, 
respectively  (Table  3).      User‟s  and  Producer‟s  Accuracies  for agriculture,  forest,  water,  and  wetlands  classes  for  both 
classifications were consistently high, ranging from 90% to 99%.  
Inconsistent PA and UA values were found for barren land, built-
up land, and rangeland classes. In the 1995 classification, the PA 
and  UA  of  built-up  land  class  are  high  at  94.9%  and  93%, 
respectively;  for  the  2017  classification,  the  PA  is  still  high  at 
93.48%  but  the  UA  decreased  to  86%  implying  higher 
commission  errors  than  that  of  1995  classification.  For  the 
barren  land  class,  the  1995  PA  and  UA  values  significantly 
increased  from  85%  to  more  than  91%.    PA  and  UA  values  for 
the  rangeland  class  were  relatively  low  for  both  classifications 
except for the 91% UA in the 1995 classification. 
 
Figure 2. Level 1 land cover classifications of the ARB for 1995 
and 2017.  
The  accuracy  of  change  detection  that  can  be  expected  from  the 
two  land  cover  maps  was  at  88.13%  (Table  3)  which  was 
obtained  by  multiplying  the  individual  classification  accuracies 
(Yuan  et  al.,2005).  Relatively  higher  change  detection  accuracy 
rates  are  found  for  agriculture  and  wetland.  High  commission 
and  omission  errors  in  change  detection  ranging  from  20%  to 
25%  are  found  for  barren  land, built-up land, and rangeland. All 
these  imply  that  some  of  the  detected  changes  are  not  actual 
changes but misclassification errors. 
 
3. 2 Land-cover change in the Whole  ARB 
 
The  individual  class  areas  and  change  statistics  for  1995  an d 
2017  are  summarized  in  Table  4.  The  1995 classification shows 
that  67.7%  of  the  ARB  is  covered  by  forest  while  agricultural 
areas are at 12.3%; barren land, rangeland and wetland follow at 
7.7%,  6.6%,  and  4.7%,  respectively.  Water  and  built-up  land 
occupies  the  least  area  of  the  ARB  at  0.8%  and  0.2%, 
respectively.  An  almost  similar  pattern  of  land  cover  dominance 
can  be  observed  for  its  2017  condition  except  that  areas 
classified  as  rangeland  has  more  area  covered  (12.2%)  than 
barren land (2.8%), making it the third most dominant land cover 
in 2017 next to forest (62.8%) and agriculture (15.5% ).  
 
3. 3  Land-cover  change  in  the  ARB  Upstream  of  Dankias 
Station 
 
Since  the  focus  of  this  study  is  on  the  analysis  of  land  cover 
change  impacts  to  the  hydrology  and  hydraulics  in  the 
downstream  portion  of  the  ARB,  particularly  in  Butuan  City,  it 
would  be  more  relevant  to  present  and  discuss  the  results  of  the 
land cover change detection and analysis that were conducted for ISPRS Annals  of the  Photogrammetry,  Remote Sensing  and Spatial  Information  Sciences, Volume IV-3/W1

the  portions  of  the  ARB  that  are  upstream  of  Dankias  Station. 
The  individual  class  areas  and  change  statistics  for  1995  and 
2017  for  these  portions  are  summarized  in  Table  5.  The  land 
cover  change  matrix  is  shown  in  Table  6  where  the  unchanged 
pixels  are  located  along  the  diagonal  of  the  matrix.  Just  like  in 
the  whole  ARB,  forest  and  agriculture  are  the  dominant  land 
cover  classes  in  this  portion  of  the  ARB  for  both  years.  From 
1995 to 2017, agricultural areas increased to 1,663 km 2
, with the 
amount  of  change  equivalent  to  3.2%  of  the  total  area  under 
consideration.  Major  contributors  in  this  increase  are  the 
agricultural  conversions  of  forest  (448  km 2
),  rangeland  (172 
km 2
),  and  rangeland  (138  km 2
).  On  other  hand,  barren  land 
decreased  to  331  km 2
  in  2017,  majority  of  which  was  due  to 
conversion  to  forest,  agriculture  and  rangeland.    The  detected 
change  in  agriculture  can  be  said  to  reflect  the actual conversion 
of  lands  for  agricultural  purposes  due  to  high  classification 
accuracies  for  this  class  in  the  1995  and  2017  classifications. 
However,  the  same  cannot  be  said  for  the  barren  lands  because 
some of the detected decrease in area can be attributed to the low 
classification accuracies in 1995 classification. 
 
The  built-up  land  in  1995  significantly  increased  by  170  km 2
 in 
2017.  It  can  be  said  that  built-up  land  area  statistics  for  1995 is 
reliable  due  to  higher  classification  accuracies  compared  to  that 
of  2017.  For  both  classifications,  there  is  also  high  confidence 
that  all  built-up  land  were  detected.  However,  overestimation  in 
built-up  land  in  2017  is  undeniable  due  to  the  14%  commission 
errors.  While  increase  in  built-up  land  through  the  years  in  the 
ARB  is  a  normal  process  due  to  increasing  population  and 
economic  development,  the  majority  of  the  detected  changes  in 
built-up  land  can  be  more  explained  by  misclassification  errors 
than  true  changes  such  as  in  the  detected    changes of built-up to 
agriculture and forest. 
 
Forest cover in this portion of the ARB decreased its area by 588 
km 2
  in  2017,  which  is  equivalent  to  4.9%  of  this  portion  of  the 
ARB . This  reduction  in  forest  cover  appears  have  been  due,  in 
majority,  to  conversion of 1995 forest cover  into rangeland (939 
km 2
),  agriculture  (448  km 2
),  and  barren  land  (175  km 2
).   While 
large tract of lands have been deforested, 229 km 2
 of agricultural 
land,  381  km 2
  of  barren  land,  and  281  km 2
  of  rangeland  have 
been  converted  into  forest.  These  detected  changes  may  be 
reflective of the National Greening Program which the Philippine 
government initiated from 2011 to 2016.  
 
Overall  (by  summing  the  non-diagonal  values  of  the  land  cover 
change  matrix),  changes  in  this  portion  of  the  ARB  accounts  to 
3,676  km 2
  (31.9%)  while  unchanged  areas  was  computed  to  be 
7,847 km 2
 (68.1%). 
 
3. 4 Flood Simulation Results 
 
The flood maps and statistics generated by the HEC RAS models 
for Butuan City under three extreme rainfall scenarios (Figure 4) 
revealed  flood  depths  and  extents  for  2017  that  are  generally 
larger  than  in  1995.  This  can  be  attributed  to  larger  volume  of 
discharge  generated  in  2017  than  in  1995.  However,  the 
dif ferences  appear  to  be  more  pronounced  for  5-year  rainfall 
scenario  (29.3%),  and  of  little  difference  for  the  25-year  and 
100-year  rainfall  scenarios  (Table  8).  This  may  imply  that  the 
impact  of  land  cover  changes  in  the  ARB  to  flood  depth  and 
extent  can  be  of  little difference as the rainfall scenarios become 
more  extreme.  However,  many  other  factors  still  need  to  be 
considered for this result to be conclusive.  Land cover

4.   CONCLUSIONS 
In  this  study,  the  impacts  of  land cover change to the hydrologic 
and  hydraulic  behaviours  of  the  ARB  was  analysed  using  an 
integrated  approach  involving  RS,  GIS,  and  hydrologic  and 
hydraulic  models.  From  the  analysis  of  Landsat  images,  land 
cover  maps  of  the  ARB  for  the  year  1995  and  2017  were 
generated with 93% overall classification accuracies. These maps 
revealed that ARB is 67.7% forest in 1995 but have decreased to 
62.8% in 2017. Agricultural areas in the basin were also found to 
have  increased  from  12.2%  to  15.5%  in  the  same  period.  Other 
notable land cover changes detected include the increase in built-
up lands and range lands, and decrease in barren lands. The land 
cover  maps  were  used  inputs  into  HEC  HMS  and  HEC  RAS 
models  simulate  the  impacts  of  the  different  land  cover 
conditions to total discharge, flood depth and extents. Simulation 
results  showed  that  there  was  an  increase  in  discharge,  flood 
depth,  and  flood  extents  between  1995  and  2017,  implying  that 
that  the  detected  changes  in  land  cover  have  negative  impacts to 
hydrologic and hydraulic behaviours of the ARB.

Abstract : This article reflects on the epistemological, methodological, and ethical issues related to  
undertaking a cross-gender research (male researcher with female participants) in one&#39;s own  
community. It also examines issues of analysis and representation germane to taking a gendered  
perspective in this study of the lives and experiences of left-behind women. The article frames the  
discussion of these issues within four interrelated sites or levels of reflexivity: theoretical reflexivity,  
gender and fieldwork relations, positionality and the insider/outsider dynamic, and representation.  
The conclusion reflects on the ethical obligation a researcher conducting a study in one&#39;s own  
community bears and the consequences of this ethical burden on representation.

1. Introduction
This article reflects on my cross-gender research with Filipino women married to  
seafarers working in the global maritime industry. The research, which I  
undertook in my home town, examined the spatio-temporality of subjectification,  
or the process of becoming historical actors. More specifically, I examined the  
spatial and temporal dimensions of the women&#39;s identity, agency, and subjectivity  
and located this examination within how they navigated their lives that were so  
shaped by the alternating absence and presence of their husband and by the  
contractual nature of their husband&#39;s work (GALAM, 2011). I looked at the  
seamen&#39;s wives not only as being affected by, and responding to, the  
consequences of migration but as also contributing to migration processes. In  
other words, I looked at the place of these women dialectically: I sought to

examine how the times and spaces of migration directed them and how they, in  
turn, directed the times and spaces of migration. Hence, I examined whether and  
how the subjective experiences of these women may be linked to wider social  
and political histories and narratives bearing in mind that they were not the  
migrants themselves. Here, I probe the ontological, epistemological,  
methodological, analytic, and ethical issues engendered by my attempt to answer  
this question and in attempting to do so by conducting the research in my own  
community. I conducted my fieldwork from February to September 2010 in San  
Gabriel (a pseudonym) in the province of Ilocos Norte, northwest Philippines. The  
semi-structured interviews I conducted with 40 women generated rich narratives  
about their lives and experiences. [ 1 ]
This article first provides a short introduction to my research, situating its concern  
for the potential for subjectification among my participants opened up by  
international migration. It locates my research within migration scholarship in the  
Philippines and explains why the research was conducted in my own community.  
In doing so, the article highlights and unpacks my positionality with a  
consideration of my studying my own community and my male gender, and I  
frame this discussion within different levels of reflexivity. I conclude with a  
reflection on the ethical implications of studying my own community and of my  
male gender on the investigation and interpretation of women&#39;s experiences as  
left-behind wives. 1

2. Positioning the Research 
My research&#39;s aim to understand the process of subjectification among seafarers&#39;  
wives was framed within the possibilities for the renegotiation of gender ideology  
and relations among women married to migrant husbands opened up by the  
restructuring of Filipino families caused by migration (PARRENAS, 2005), that is,  
by the absence of the women&#39;s husbands for long periods of time. Left-behind  
wives, through the responsibilities and tasks they do in the absence of their  
husband, sustain male emigration (BRETTELL, 1986; KANAIAUPUNI, 2000). As  
Shawn KANAIAUPUNI (2000, p.2) has written: 
&#34;women and their labours in origin villages are crucial to the migration process— they  
make men&#39;s migration possible and ensure its continuity across space and time . As  
such, they form the invisible backbone of this transnational migration process that  
has endured for over a century.&#34; [ 3 ]
Since the 1970s, the Philippines has pursued an aggressive labor export policy.  
In the last few years, the Philippine government, through its Philippine Overseas  
Employment Agency (POEA), has aimed to deploy at least a million workers  
overseas (TYNER, 2009). In 2013, more than 1.8 million Filipinos were deployed  
for overseas work. The export of labor has become a major part of both economic  
and foreign policies of the Philippine state, and a structural feature of the  
1 Although I am aware of the negative connotations of the term &#34;left behind&#34; (see, for example,  
ARCHAMBAULT, 2010), I use it because the Filipino seamen&#39;s wives I interviewed referred to  
themselves as  nabati , best translated as &#34;left behind.&#34;

country&#39;s political economy (LINDQUIST, 1993; RODRIGUEZ, 2010). The  
Philippines has become very dependent on foreign remittances. Around 21.4  
billion US dollars were sent by over ten million overseas Filipinos in 2012. This  
amount represents around 8.5 per cent of the country&#39;s gross domestic product  
(GDP). [ 4 ]
Aside from examining how the absence of the women&#39;s husband might provide  
experiences for the women that might lead to changes in their identity and  
agency, my research sought to help address, if not redress, the peripheral status  
of seafarers&#39; families in Philippine migration scholarship. Migration scholarship in  
and on the Philippines has predominantly focused on land-based workers and  
has generally paid little attention to seafarers (AGUILAR, 2002; CONSTABLE,  
1997; FAIER, 2009; GUEVARRA, 2009; PARRENAS, 2001; PINGOL, 2001;  
RODRIGUEZ, 2010). Although seafarers represent about 20 percent of the  
annual total number of deployed overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), they remain  
marginal in Philippine migration research. Even more peripheral are their families.  
Where migration research has examined the lives and experiences of those who  
stay behind, it has focused mainly on the families of land-based overseas  
workers. The Philippines is the global shipping industry&#39;s biggest source of  
seafarers; more than 25 per cent of the world&#39;s total work force of 1.4 million  
seafarers are Filipinos. In 2012, almost 367,000 Filipino seafarers were working  
onboard international ships (IOM, 2013). The Philippines thus provided an ideal  
case with and through which to examine how non-migrant women become  
implicated in overseas migration processes. [ 5 ]
I chose San Gabriel as my research site for its long history of migration,  
particularly to Hawaii. Internal migration, which began in the 1850s, and  
international migration, particularly to Hawaii and California in the USA, which  
began in the first decade of the 1900s, have been used to escape the economic  
and social limitations in the Ilocos Region. In order to see how migration brings  
economic and social improvement, and to get a sense of how migration is  
invested with the hope for improved life chances (see GALAM, 2015), it was  
necessary to conduct the research in a place that has participated in, and been  
significantly affected by, migration. Not only is there a large number of people  
from San Gabriel who have immigrated to the United States and elsewhere, it  
also has a considerable number of labor emigrants, those who left the country for  
overseas jobs through the labor export policy of the Philippine state. [ 6 ]
3. Reflexivity and Conducting a Cross-Gender Study 
in One&#39;s Own Community 
The examination of researchers&#39; relationship with meaning, interpretation,  
representation, knowledge, and power in their work has become a necessary part  
of research methodology and practice particularly among qualitative researchers.  
There have been searching and self-critical examinations of reflexivity in  
sociology (KUSOW, 2003; SMITH, 1987; STANLEY & WISE, 1983),  
anthropology (BRANDES, 2008; DAWSON, 2010; ENGUIX, 2014; LAMPHERE,  
RAGONE & ZAVELLA, 1997; NARAYAN, 1993; SHERIF, 2001; WOLF, 1996),

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
and geography (CHACKO, 2004; ENGLAND, 1994; GILBERT, 1994;  
McDOWELL, 1992a; ROSE, 1997; SULTANA, 2007; TURNER, 2013) especially  
in feminist research. In addition, scholars have highlighted the importance of  
exercising reflexivity to understand how gender and gender relations affect or  
constitute interviews (HEROD, 1993; KUSOW, 2003; McDOWELL, 1992b;  
SCHOENBERGER, 1992; TAKEDA, 2012). This section focuses specifically on  
issues of reflexivity and I have categorized four interrelated areas through which  
to discuss different forms and levels of reflexivity. These are theoretical reflexivity,  
gender and fieldwork relations, positionality and the &#34;insider-outsider&#34; dynamic,  
and representation. Methodological and ethical issues germane to each of these  
sites are addressed accordingly. [ 7 ]
3.1 Theoretical reflexivity: Male feminism
The question of men being and becoming feminists has been a controversial one  
(ADU-POKU, 2001; ALILUNAS, 2011; DIGBY, 1998; FLOOD, 2011; GARDINER,  
2002; KIMMELL, 1998; LEMONS, 1997; MURPHY, 2004; SHEPHERD, 1997;  
STANOVSKY, 1997) especially because feminism was involved in &#34;the critique of  
masculinist knowledge&#34; (McDOWELL, 1992a, p.401). For Gary LEMONS (1997,  
p.50), however, men and feminism were not incommensurable nor even  
incompatible: &#34;The idea that men cannot in feminist alliance with women politically  
subvert the power of male supremacy is like saying white people in anti-racist  
solidarity with black people cannot divest themselves of white supremacist  
thinking.&#34; [ 8 ]
The important role of men in the feminist struggle has been noted:
&#34;Men who advocate feminism as a movement to end sexist oppression must become  
more vocal and public in their opposition to sexism and sexist oppression. Until men  
share equal responsibility for struggling to end sexism, feminist movement will reflect  
the very sexist contradictions we wish to eradicate. [...] In particular, men have a  
tremendous contribution to make to feminist struggle in the area of exposing,  
confronting, opposing, and transforming the sexism of their male peers&#34; (HOOKS,  
1984, pp.80-81). [ 9 ]
Nevertheless, the position that feminism was the preserve of women was widely  
held. As GILBERT (1994) pointed out, although there was much debate about  
what constituted feminist epistemology and methodology, it was generally  
accepted that feminist research should be &#34;by, for, and about women&#34; (GLUCK &  
PATAI, 1991, p.2 as cited in GILBERT, 1994, p.90). Thus, to justify their  
feminism, male feminists called into question the &#34;natural&#34; link between women  
and feminism and argued that feminism should be about positions. HEATH  
(1987, p.1) claimed that women &#34;are not feminists by virtue of the fact alone of  
being women: feminism is a social-political reality, a struggle, a commitment,  
women become feminists.&#34; HOPKINS (1998, pp.51-52) argued that &#34;feminism  
should be characterized by adherence to a basic set of beliefs and political  
positions ... the core of feminism would be feminist positions, not women&#39;s  
experiences.&#34; [ 10 ]

in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
Over the years, feminist scholarship has shifted emphasis &#34;away from women  
towards gender, allowing issues about the social construction of and  
geographical variations in masculinity as well as femininity to be raised&#34;  
(McDOWELL, 1992a, p.400) and &#34;women have cautiously called for men&#39;s  
participation in feminist movements&#34; (PLEASANTS, 2011, p.231; see also  
EDWARDS, 2008). In addition, male scholars studying masculinity have pointed  
out that this required looking at femininity (BRANDES, 2008; GUTMANN, 1996).  
As BRANDES (2008, p.151) wrote, &#34;you cannot study men with taking account of  
women, and vice versa.&#34; Increasingly, attention has been drawn to the need to  
build alliances and solidarities between men and women feminists. Rather than  
see feminism as exclusive to women, it should be seen as &#34;sites for a discourse  
that acknowledges the connection between feminist concerns and issues of race,  
class, and sexual orientation&#34; (BREEZE, 2007, p.60). Feminism requires the  
participation of a diverse population especially because feminist issues are  
deeply rooted in structures and relations of power. An intersectional politics that  
linked gender and other structures of power such as race, class, ethnicity, and  
nationality (CONNELL, 1995; GUTMANN, 1997; PLEASANTS, 2011) was seen to  
advance the sharing of feminist values and principles (SHEPHERD, 1997). Men  
could thus speak and act as feminists but their doing so is premised on  
collaborative and participatory voice and action. They speak with women  
(BREEZE, 2007; GALAM, 2008; STANOVSKY, 1997), not for or in behalf of  
them. My reflections on the methodological, analytic, and representational  
strategies I made hopefully will make explicit and demonstrate how I speak with  
the women who participated in my research. In critically examining these choices  
I made, I lay bare the ways by which I participated in making sense of how they  
navigated their lives and experiences defined by the alternating absence and  
presence of their husbands, an absence-presence caused by the limited social  
possibilities available in the Philippines, and that became the condition of  
possibility of their subjectification. [ 11 ]
The remaining sections of the article examine how I have been able to undertake  
my research using a feminist perspective, the challenges I confronted, and the  
decisions I made, which have epistemological, methodological, representational  
and ethical implications. [ 12 ]
3.2 Gender and the negotiation of fieldwork relations 
Reflections on the impact of gender on the negotiation of fieldwork relations,  
particularly by researchers whose participants included genders other than their  
own, have spotlighted how gender is central and marginal to the research  
depending on the situation (AL-MAKHAMREH & LEWANDO-HUNDT, 2008;  
ENGUIX, 2014; GUTMANN, 1996, 1997, 2002; KUSOW, 2003; TAKEDA, 2012).  
This situational and contextual appreciation of the role played by gender in  
fieldwork relations engenders a dynamic perspective of how gender interacts with  
other social and cultural categories and factors germane to the research. It  
underscores the negotiatedness and relationality of research and compels the  
researcher to pay attention to where gender facilitates research and where it  
establishes boundaries. McKEGANEY and BLOOR (1991) noted that the cross-
FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
gender nature of their study affected the physical spaces they had access to.  
BRANDES (1992, p.33) reported on his fieldwork in Andalusia where strict gender  
domains or sexual boundaries prevailed and which defined his &#34;informant pool  
and research possibilities,&#34; and as a consequence, his access to the women was  
gained through their husbands (see also BRANDES, 2008). Although PINGOL  
(2001), who interviewed the husbands of migrant women, noted that gender did  
not pose serious problems to her relationship with her participants, she  
nonetheless acknowledged that she was able to discuss sexual matters more  
openly with the wives because she was also a woman and a wife. [ 13 ]
Prior to my fieldwork, I was concerned about how my male gender was going to  
affect my ability to invite and recruit women to participate in my study. There was  
also the matter of how the cross-gender nature of the study was going to affect  
the interview itself. Admittedly, the sensitivity of some of the issues the research  
was dealing with, particularly the absence of sexual intimacy, caused me this  
concern. As a male researcher whose participants were women, I thought that  
there were questions and, therefore, spaces of these women&#39;s lives that were  
already foreclosed to me or that I would have difficulty negotiating. Two things  
might be said of how gender shaped my research.  First, gender affected the kind  
of questions asked, the degree of probing done, and how comfortable the women  
and I felt during the interview, that is, the &#34;micro-world&#34; of the dialogic constitution  
of meaning and sharing of stories.  Even then, other factors were present. First is  
the fact I am married and have children and away from my wife for seven of the  
eight months of the fieldwork. (Participants knew my marital and family status  
because they asked about these things when I was inviting them to participate in  
my study). Indeed, in many interviews, women said that as a father and a married  
man, I knew and understood what they were saying, for example, about the  
difficulties mothers face in disciplining children when the family&#39;s traditional  
authority figure is absent. Although this allowed me to draw on a discourse of  
&#34;shared experience&#34; and enabled me to exercise  Verstehen  (empathetic  
understanding), there was a limit to what we shared. For example, I did not live  
with my in-laws, whereas many of my research participants did and which vitally  
shaped their lives and experiences as women whose husbands were away.  
Nevertheless, the point is that my being married and a father helped me and the  
participants negotiate certain topics and aspects of their lives. Furthermore, even  
more importantly, my being married was crucial in securing the participation of a  
number of the women. They explicitly indicated that it was an important factor in  
their participation. My analysis of the dynamic of our conversation when I was  
inviting them to participate (particularly the questions they asked which suggested  
to me the concerns that were most important to them) indicated that they were  
weighing how their participation was going to be perceived by others (family  
members and relatives they lived with in the same house or neighbors who are  
either their own or their husbands&#39; relatives). In other words, they were already  
considering the potential of their participation for being framed by others within  
infidelity. I thought that their questions about who I was and where I lived were  
not only to determine whether I was someone they would trust. They were also  
concerned about protecting themselves from suspicions of sexual misconduct.  [ 14 ]

in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
Second, there was the wider environment within which the interview was located  
and in which gender was only one factor influencing it. Cultural, social, and age  
factors dictated the amount of privacy I had in interviewing the women, and to a  
certain extent, the degree of openness that we could talk about private and  
intimate matters. Domestic arrangements, for example, shared residence,  
determined in which part of the house I could interview them. A few women,  
particularly those below 30 years old, were initially accompanied by another  
woman who would eventually leave to go elsewhere in the house. The husbands  
of two women were present during their interview and participated in the process.  
Although I thought that they would have left us alone had I been a woman, I was  
convinced their &#34;interest&#34; also lay in what would be talked about. Despite their  
presence, I was still able to ask my questions on intimacy. [ 15 ]
While I was rightly worried about how gender would affect how well I would be  
able to undertake the research, reflecting on the issue later on led me to agree  
with LOIZOS (1992, p.173): 
&#34;It is not so much whether the fieldworker is male or female,  tout court,  which is likely  
to be decisive, but the combination of gender, age, marital status, and topic of  
research interest. If all the values in the equation are &#39;wrong&#39;, then the researcher is  
indeed disadvantaged.&#34; [ 16 ]
To what extent these values might go &#34;wrong,&#34; I argue, depends in part on the  
character participants see the researcher to possess or demonstrate. In  
interview-based research, there is very little time, if at all, for researchers to  
cultivate a &#34;reputation&#34; or character based on interaction between them and their  
interviewees prior to the interview. That reputation preceded me by way of the  
people who introduced me to them. It was my responsibility during the interview  
to build on that. PITT-RIVERS (1992) writes that in research, there is the element  
of presenting a certain kind of persona, a projection of character meant to win  
acceptance. A researcher needs &#34;a certain amount of charm or at least the  
sincere desire to make of himself agreeable to persons whom he might not in  
other circumstances have chosen as companions&#34; (p.140). I certainly made every  
effort to make myself agreeable to the women and the people around them.  
Where other family members were around during the interview, I made sure to  
say &#34; addaak ,  tata ,  nana ,  manong  or  manang &#34; (a way of paying courtesy to them;  
tata  for their father,  nana  for their mother,  manong  for an older male sibling or  
relative,  manang  for a female one). This was one way by which I negotiated my  
relationship with the participants prior to the start of the interview. All throughout  
my interaction with them, I used terms of respect ( manang  for women older than  
me;  ading  for those younger). I spoke in a tone and manner that I thought would  
indicate my respect for them. Michael BLOOR (2001, p.392) has written that 
&#34;[a]ll encounters between researchers and researched are species of social  
relationships governed by conventions of politeness and etiquette; in the case of  
ethnographic research the relationship in question may well embrace fondness and  
regard. Fieldwork methods and fieldwork relations will shape the nature and content  
of members&#39; responses.&#34; [ 17 ]

in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
Below, I reflect further on my fieldwork experiences, ones that not only highlight  
the negotiation of fieldwork relationships but also methodological and ethical  
issues. [ 18 ]
Being accompanied by someone the women knew was crucial in speaking to the  
women and in minimizing suspicion about the purpose of my research. Kinship  
ties or the ability of the women to place me within &#34;familiarizing&#34; systems helped  
me recruit them to participate. In a number of instances, I was first asked what  
my surname was, which family I came from, who was my mother, etc. All of these  
were ways of identifying me in their own terms rather than relying on the  
researcher identity stamped on the research information sheet. The information  
sheet, which was in Ilokano, the native language spoken in the place, was not of  
much use. The women were more receptive and more positively predisposed to  
giving me a chance if I personally talked to them. Three women agreed to be  
interviewed because they knew my family or one of my siblings belonged to the  
same high school class as they did. They made clear they were agreeing to be  
interviewed because they knew my family or could link me to someone they  
knew. I think that this was their way of being assured that whatever it is that they  
were going to say, they knew that they told it to someone they could trust and  
someone trustworthy because ‘known&#39; to them through other members of my  
family. [ 19 ]
Not all introductions, however, worked. I had seven rejections and two who  
backed out. Various reasons were given (although I did not ask for any) some of  
which had nothing to do with the research. One did not want to be interviewed  
because a week before I spoke to her, her house was burgled and was  
suspicious of anyone wanting to ask her about her life as the wife of a seaman.  
Understandably, she did not want someone she hardly knew to be inside her  
house. Indeed, there were a few who openly expressed suspicion about my  
intentions. One asked me whether I was doing surveillance ( agtiktiktik ). The  
women&#39;s initial hesitation was overcome when I assured them that I was not  
going to ask them about how much their husband earned although I made it clear  
I would ask them about budgeting. The wife who thought I might be snitching was  
reassured when I told her I had interviewed other women in a neighboring village  
one of whom referred her to me. She asked me who had given me her name and  
as I could not remember who of those I interviewed had done so, I mentioned,  
with hesitation, an interviewee off the top of my head, which was a marvelous  
stroke of luck as she happened to be this woman&#39;s best friend. (She probably had  
an inkling it was her friend who gave her name to me). She then quickly called  
her up by cell phone to confirm whether I had been telling the truth. She agreed  
to be interviewed after that phone call. [ 20 ]
Revealing the identity of one participant to a potential one is an ethical issue that  
brings up another. If the only way a potential interviewee can feel reassured  
about participating is by knowing who else has participated, which is also their  
rapid way of gauging a researcher&#39;s trustworthiness, is this a justifiable reason to  
do so? What is involved here is an &#34;economy of trust&#34; and as a researcher, I  
decided in favor of giving the information. In the case that prompted this  
FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
reflection, the potential interviewee was referred by another I had interviewed and  
as such, suggests that the former would have the right to know who had referred  
her to me. [ 21 ]
Methodological and ethical concerns about anonymity might be raised specially in  
the case of participants who were interviewed in the presence of a third party.  
One could ask why I did not arrange for the interviews to be done in a neutral and  
more private place. There were very few establishments in the town where I did  
my fieldwork that could have served this purpose. There is a snack house in the  
town center ( poblacion ) where I could have done the interviews but such a  
&#34;neutral&#34; place would not have given the participants and me the quiet and  
privacy demanded by such methodological and ethical considerations. It did not  
guarantee their anonymity and the confidentiality of what they shared as others  
would most likely have overheard our conversation. [ 22 ]
Interviewing the women in a &#34;neutral&#34; place to ensure their anonymity would have  
been more methodologically and ethically questionable as it would have put them  
in a difficult and compromised position. The women would certainly not have  
agreed to such an arrangement. I cannot overemphasize the power exercised by  
the absence of the women&#39;s husbands in terms of their behavior and mobility,  
particularly with being seen with a man who is not their relative. This is specially  
the case with the younger wives I interviewed. The women were very concerned  
that people who know their husbands would talk about them being seen with a  
man and that stories would be spun around it. That some of these women were  
accompanied by another during the interview in their own place of residence  
gives an indication of the care they took to be above any suspicions of infidelity.  
That others (including their neighbors) know that a male visitor came to speak to  
them helps vouch for their character. Earlier, I talked about the questions the  
women I was inviting to participate asked me, ones that inquired about my  
personal and family background. These questions were not only about helping  
them decide whether or not to participate. They were also about putting me within  
as thick a network of social relations as they can possibly accomplish within that  
time of getting to know more about me. Its purpose is that the more they can say  
about me to people who will ask them about my visit, the more able they are to  
show that there is nothing to be suspicious about. The more they can say about  
me, if and when they are asked, the more open they are about it. The more open  
they are means they are not hiding anything. Anonymity in the sense that others  
do not know they have participated in my research is not desirable or appropriate  
because it put the women at great risk of suspicion of doing something they  
should not be doing. [ 23 ]
3.2.1 The absence of husbands and the sensitivity of intimacy 
Asking the women about intimacy particularly with their husbands or the absence  
of it was fertile ground for misinterpretation. The absence of their husbands so  
suffused their lives that questions about what they talked about during phone  
conversations or about what wives found difficult during their husbands&#39; absence  
were almost always understood to allude to issues of sexual intimacy or its

in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
absence. My generic question about what the women and their husbands talked  
about during phone conversations elicited giggles and laughter from interviewees.  
My interview question concerning the couples&#39; topics of phone conversations was  
asked at the beginning of the interview and was intended to inquire into non-
intimate aspects of their lives. My question concerning how wives dealt with  
missing their husbands was placed near the end of the interview for strategic  
reasons. Let me use my interview with Maricel, in her early 30s and who has two  
children, as example here. 
Researcher: When your husband calls, what do you usually talk about?
Maricel: [Giggles]. The children,  manong . He would ask about how we are. I do the  
same. Also ... [begins to laugh] the usual with couples ... &#34;How are you?,&#34; he asks. 2
 
[ 24 ]
Although she tried to give a generic answer, when Maricel struggled as she  
alternated between giggling and suppressing her giggles, she inadvertently  
alluded to something more private. The interview with Maricel on this question  
lasted much longer than is indicated by the brevity of this extract. She eventually  
asked me if we could skip the question and come back to it when she had  
collected herself. [ 25 ]
How my question was framed or understood within absence and intimacy is also  
evident in my interview with Laura, a chief engineer&#39;s wife. Laura had given birth  
to her third child only ten days prior to the interview. She had told me that her  
husband was going back to sea in a few days&#39; time. I asked her what she felt  
about her husband having to leave so soon after her having a new baby. Before  
this, she had talked about how her husband liked her cooking and how she  
shifted the focus of her attention from her children to her husband. Because of  
the birth, she had had very little chance to do either. This was what I had in mind  
when I asked the question but Laura understood it in terms of sexual intimacy. I  
asked follow-up questions according to my framing of my original question and  
Laura answered based on what she understood I was referring to. Here is the  
relevant part of the interview:
Researcher: How is that then, of course, you&#39;ve just given birth and he is soon to  
leave?
Laura: Yes, that is true.
R: How do you feel about it?
Laura: Sad. It&#39;s because I wasn&#39;t able to give him my what, my responsibility to him  
because it is not really possible. That&#39;s why. I try instead to make him enjoy his time  
with the children. So he is at least happy before he goes. As he told me, &#34;when I  
come back.&#34; 
R: You will make up?
Laura: Yes. I said I will make up for it. No other way.

English translation. All interview extracts in this article are quoted in English. All names used are

in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
R: You owe him. Of course he understands it?
Laura: He understands. [ 26 ]
I realized when I transcribed the interview that a misunderstanding had occurred  
here. As I read Laura&#39;s responses, I became increasingly convinced she had  
taken my question to refer to sexual intimacy. What she said—that she &#34;was not  
able to give him [her husband] her what, my responsibility to him because it is no  
really possible&#34; and what she reported as her husband&#39;s response, &#34;when I come  
back,&#34;—clearly do not refer to her cooking but rather to her not being able to  
have sex with her husband. I wanted to make sure I had not forced or imposed  
this interpretation or realization so I went back to the recorded interview for clues  
such as tone of voice, pauses, and hesitations. Indeed this exercise supported  
my realization. I asked myself if I had not really referred to sex in my question or  
that I had really missed the whole point during the interview. What proof is there  
in the interview that I had genuinely missed the sexual reference in Laura&#39;s  
response? My simple answer is that I kept asking questions. Had I understood  
what she meant right from the start, I would not have asked the last two  
questions in the interview extract. 3
 [ 27 ]
Asking the women how they dealt with the absence of their husbands was  
sensitive to them for at least two reasons. First, it was a topic that was too private  
and sensitive to talk about. To bring in or introduce the topic, I reminded them  
that they could choose not to answer it. Although the fact that the participants  
could choose not to answer any question they did not feel like answering was  
made clear in the participant information sheet and before the start of the  
interview, and that everything they were going to share would be confidential, in  
many instances I had difficulty transitioning to this topic. The easiest and most  
effective way I found was to say that what I was going to ask next was one they  
could refuse to answer. Second, it was sensitive, and this I would only realize in  
the course of my fieldwork, in that the question somehow put them in a defensive  
position and it did so because the question resonated with perceptions and  
suspicions of infidelity that surrounded them. And so when I asked what activities  
they did in order not to miss their husbands too much, women parried it  
immediately with a response that defended their honor and dignity: that they were  
not like other women who would seek to satisfy their sexual needs by having  
relations with another man. In turn, this put me on the defensive because I had no  
intention to even suggest infidelity and I was concerned not to offend them.  
Needless to say, I assured them I was not questioning their character. Aware that  
the matter was sensitive but only in the first sense discussed above especially in  
my early interviews, I always made sure that my tone was especially polite. [ 28 ]
3 Although this interview extract, especially the last question, could potentially be seen to betray  
gendered assumptions about what I expect women to do for their husbands, I wish to make it  
clear here that I do not actually hold this expectation. The follow-up questions about Laura being  
unable to give her husband the attention she usually did when he was home were meant to get  
details of how she felt about it, as well as how her husband understood the situation. In other  
words, I wanted to know more about how both were adjusting to the further demands made on  
both of them by the birth of a new child, demands that did not enable Laura to shift the focus of  
her attention from her children to her husband, which she said is what she did when her  
husband was home.

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
This raises the issue of why I inquired about this matter aside from the fact that  
their husband&#39;s absence was obviously something the women had to face. I had  
been interested in finding out how the women rationalized their situation. More  
specifically, in one of my pilot interviews, a seaman&#39;s wife described her life as  
&#34; kasla agibaklay ti krus &#34; (like bearing a cross), a clear reference to Jesus Christ&#39;s  
suffering on the road to Calvary. This led me to think of this issue in terms of how  
they would have worked through the absence of physical and sexual intimacy  
within a discourse of sacrifice that I thought might potentially be informed by  
religious discourse. In other words, I wanted to explore whether this deprivation  
would be made sense of as a necessary part of providing for the lives and futures  
of their family (see GALAM, 2012). [ 29 ]
The sensitivity of the situation of the women, particularly their being cast as  
&#34;vulnerable&#34; or women who could be tempted and led astray presented a situation  
in which I , as a male researcher visiting and talking to them, potentially put them  in  
a compromising position. Moreover, the topic of my research and the questions I  
was asking also necessitated careful negotiation of the dynamic involved  
particularly pertaining to issues of intimacy and sexual longing. In the section that  
follows, I reflect further on how the topic of conversation shapes the dynamic of  
the interaction between a (male) researcher and (female) participant. [ 30 ]
3.2.2 Testing the limits of what is ethical 
Whereas I was hesitant to probe the issue of intimacy out of respect for the  
interviewees as it was not a topic of conversation that is talked about openly let  
alone with a stranger, and out of my own discomfort, I did not have the same  
hesitance or tentativeness in asking questions about the women&#39;s relationship  
with their mothers-in-law. When the subject was raised in relation to other  
aspects of the women&#39;s lives, I followed it up and kept asking questions to such a  
point I had to ask myself whether going further was still ethical. At least two  
women asked to be reassured before answering that what they were going to say  
would be confidential. In the split-second I had to decide whether or not to  
proceed further (albeit cautiously) with my probing, I had to weigh whether doing  
so already constituted gratuitous &#34;voyeurism&#34; or necessary for a &#34;thick  
description&#34; and understanding of how these women lived with and suffered from  
their mother-in-law. For the women who lived with their mother-in-law, their  
relationship with her was a major factor that shaped their agency and the power  
that they were able to exercise. Asking the women why their relationship with  
their mother-in-law was not good meant that the women had to confront  
emotional pain and fear (of the consequences of disclosure). The question also  
put a number of the women in an uneasy and awkward position as it involved  
talking about their mothers-in-law in their mothers-in-law&#39;s own house. Whereas I  
needed a &#34;misunderstanding&#34; between Laura and me (discussed in the previous  
section) in order to ask follow-up questions, my pursuit of the discussion of the  
conflicted relationship between the women participants and their mothers-in-law  
was done with dogged but careful persistence. [ 31 ]

in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
My negotiation of fieldwork relations clearly shows that negotiating the cross-
gender nature of the study did not have to be limited to dealing with the gender  
dynamic. Successfully negotiating linguistic, cultural, social, demographic (such  
as age) and spatial factors, which might also help attest to the good character of  
the researcher, is equally vital not only to researcher-participant relationships but  
also to the wider relational context (for example, how husbands, parents, or in-
laws might react to or perceive the interview) within which wives, particularly, are  
located. Researchers, however, do not have the sort of power nor influence to  
enable them to control for the contingencies of human relations and interactions.  
As BRANDES (1992, p.38) has put it: 
&#34;Our gender identity, like our age, marital status, and personality, will always in some  
way intervene. It is neither we as individuals nor the structure of the societies and  
cultures we study that alone determines the information available to us. Rather, an  
interaction of all these factors is what yields the final corpus of data. Under such  
inevitable circumstances it is comforting to know that whatever we learn is a lot, as  
long as we are honest about the conditions under which the learning took place ... the  
way we interact with our informants can be as filled with cultural information as their  
words and deeds.&#34; [ 32 ]
In negotiating fieldwork relations, I made decisions that have methodological and  
ethical implications. These decisions centered on not putting the women at risk of  
being suspected of infidelity and I discussed how this issue determined and  
dictated the place where I interviewed the women (see last two paragraphs of  
Section 3.2). I also discussed how the place of interview, aside from embodying  
an ethical obligation to the women, also existed in tension with holding on to a  
strict notion of anonymity shaped and defined in research practices and contexts  
of societies and cultures that are very different from those where I did my  
fieldwork. Farhana SULTANA (2007, p.374) has noted the differing conditions  
surrounding the implementation of &#34;institutional ethics formalities&#34; in the Global  
South and in the Global North and urges researchers conducting international  
fieldwork to bear in mind &#34;negotiated ethics in the field&#34; (p.375). The place of  
interview also left me with very little choice as to who else would be present or  
around. I do not doubt that the presence of others affected what the women  
shared or could share. Despite the presence of others, I made every effort to  
cover the issues that my research sought to examine. This is demonstrated in the  
part of the interview which dealt with the women&#39;s relationship with their mothers-
in-law. In order to examine critically how the lives and experiences of the  
seafarer&#39;s wives were shaped by their relationships with their mothers-in-law,  
relationships that the women revealed to be fraught with difficulties, I needed to  
ask the wives questions that became more difficult to answer because of where  
the interview was taking place. Of course, the degree of following up I did took  
into serious account the presence of others especially the mothers-in-law who,  
despite not being physically within hearing distance, exercised a &#34;haunting&#34;  
presence. It was necessary to pursue the discussion because the issue spoke  
fundamentally to structures and relations of power and their consequences on the  
agency, subjectivity, and identity of the participants. Also, asking follow-up  
questions not only would clarify the issue but also, as a consequence, would

in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
generate accounts that would serve as better bases for analyzing and interpreting  
structures and relations of power between the wife and her mother-in-law. [ 33 ]
3.3 Language as marker of class and educational hierarchy 
In multilingual societies, fluency in one or more native languages in addition to  
the national language has its advantages. This becomes even more  
advantageous to the research in a country that has gone through colonialism,  
such as the Philippines, where a language becomes implicated in hierarchy. My  
pilot interviews emphasized how the use of Ilokano (the native language of the  
Ilocos Region and most of Northern Luzon) or Filipino would help minimize  
asymmetries of power relationships between researcher and participant. It  
flagged how English was a marker of social and class or socio-economic  
differences in the Philippines. My first pilot interviewee, for example, asked  
whether she had to speak in English; if she had to, she was not sure she had  
enough reserve of English. She worried in jest that the interview would not yet  
have finished but she would have run out of English. The language factor had the  
potential of putting her in what WETHERELL (1998) called &#34;a troubled subject  
position.&#34; Her anxiety about the use of English was not only due to whether she  
spoke it fluently enough but also with what her English fluency level implied. In  
the Philippines, English is the language of government (together with Filipino), of  
the elite, of the educated. It is frequently a marker of class position and  
educational attainment. This was tellingly demonstrated when she said that she  
did not want to come off  boba  (thick).  Her concern spotlighted not only the  
colonial history of this linguistic relation but also that it was freighted with a history  
of economic, social and class hierarchy . [ 34 ]
While it is true that I speak fluent English due to my having obtained university  
degrees, I share the socioeconomic background of many of my research  
participants. Nevertheless, I am aware that my education has enabled me to  
achieve more social mobility and that the participants might assume on the basis  
of it that I have a higher socio-economic standing. I felt that this might predispose  
them to behave towards me in a deferential way rather than occupy an equal  
position in the researcher-participant relationship; indeed, that they were doing  
me a big favor. I needed them for my research whereas they had absolutely no  
need of me. I tried to minimize how this might impact on the interview. Where  
interviews were conducted in the women&#39;s house, I removed my shoes or sandals  
and left them by the door as a gesture of respect. Also, I wanted to demonstrate  
through my actions that although I was at a personal level a stranger to them,  
culturally and socio-economically, I was not. Visitors, especially strangers, whom  
hosts perceive to occupy a higher socio-economic position would unlikely be  
asked to leave their footwear outside of the house. By voluntarily removing mine,  
I wanted to indicate a shared socio-economic background. I invested in these  
acts with these meanings hoping, by virtue of shared culture, that they would see  
them as such. I spoke in Ilokano, our native language, and assured them the  
interview would be conducted in the language they were most comfortable with.  
Where appropriate, I spoke only in Ilokano taking care not to mix in Filipino or  
English words. Where my interviewees mixed languages, I also did. Speaking in

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
a language and register that mirrored my participants&#39; was another way by which I  
tried to address the socio-economic differences that my educational attainment  
might have implied or brought to relief. [ 35 ]
My fluency in two Philippine languages (Ilokano and Filipino), which all of my  
participants spoke, had two significant consequences on my research. First, it  
had epistemological, analytic, and representational implications for my research.  
Because I was interested in narratives and accounts of women&#39;s experiences of  
the migration of their seamen-husbands, I had to speak their language so that the  
disclosure of life narratives and their analysis would not suffer from language  
issues and the mediation of a translator. How women talked about their lives and  
themselves, the particular words, images and metaphors they used are significant  
to a description and conceptualization of their spatio-temporality. Hence, the  
importance of speaking the native language and the careful transcription of the  
interviews (see, for example, BECKER, 1999; BLOOR, FRANKLAND, THOMAS  
& ROBSON, 2001). Interview extracts quoted in the study had to be translated  
into English. A translation based on a paraphrased transcription (which in itself  
already constitutes a translation) of interviews risks losing the nuances of the  
women&#39;s representation and narration of their lives and experiences. Translation  
is a complex activity and in translating culturally loaded terms, concepts, and  
metaphors, the aporia of rendering them into English adequately is always  
present. Translation always involves interpretation so that what is presented as  
coming from the interviewee already carries traces of the researcher&#39;s or  
translator&#39;s mediation. In this sense, translation, and research more broadly, is  
not only invested with biographical and identity work (COFFEY, 1999) but also  
with interpretive frames and politics (GIORDANO, 2008; PAPASTERGIADIS,  
2000; RAFAEL, 1988, 2005; RIESSMAN, 2008). [ 36 ]
The second consequence of my fluency in the women&#39;s native languages on my  
research is that it spoke directly to my position vis-a-vis the participants. My  
language competence went hand in hand with my cultural competence both of  
which significantly made it easier for me to negotiate fieldwork relations and the  
analysis and interpretation of what the participants shared. I examine further the  
relational construction of my positioning in the next section. [ 37 ]
3.4 Positionality and the insider/outsider dialectic 
Positionality is a praxis of examining relationships and interactions that develop  
and unfold during the research and of making sense of insights and knowledge  
generated by such relationships and interactions. It might be taken to refer to  
&#34;aspects of identity in terms of race, class, gender, caste, sexuality and other  
attributes that are markers of  relational  positions in society, rather than intrinsic  
qualities&#34; (CHACKO, 2004, p.52). Because positionality arises from the  
negotiation of various relationships and interactions, it is &#34;contingent and  
contested&#34; (ibid.). Consequently, a researcher does not occupy a fixed and  
clearly defined position in her relation to the research and participants. [ 38 ]

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
The dichotomous construction of insiderness and outsiderness as privileged  
positions or standpoints of knowledge has received sustained interrogation, with  
Robert MERTON (1972) being one of the first (in sociology) to provide a  
systematic critique exposing its untenability. The oppositional construction of  
i nsiderness and outsiderness would make researchers &#34;either objective and  
credible or subjective, biased, and generating questionable research outcomes&#34;  
(SAVVIDES, AL-YOUSSEF, COLIN & GARRIDO, 2014, p.414). Qualitative social  
science researchers have nuanced the relationship between these two positions  
pointing to the reality of researchers occupying a spectrum or continuum of  
insider and outsider positions in relation to their research and interaction with  
participants (CARLING, ERDAL & EZZATI, 2014; COURT & ABBAS, 2013;  
DAWSON, 2010; ERGUN & ERDEMIR, 2010; HELLAWELL, 2006; MERRIAM et  
al., 2001; SAVVIDES et al., 2014). In this section, I look at this insider/outsider  
dynamic highlighting instances in my research and interactions with participants  
and others that became the vehicles for me to reflect on how I was both an  
insider and outsider. [ 39 ]
My interviews were supplemented by observations and my access to the cultural  
and social worlds of the women&#39;s lives, which I share because of shared ethno-
linguistic identity. My sharing with them, for example, the native language also  
allowed me to grasp the nuances of their responses, as well as the cultural, social  
and religious allusions of the metaphors they used not only to talk about, but also  
to configure, their lives and experiences. Here, one example will suffice to  
illustrate this. One wife spoke of her family&#39;s financial situation as sometimes  
nakibbutan  (emptied).  Nakibbutan  is a term used in  sungka , a game played by  
two players whose goal is to accumulate as many shells from the competitor&#39;s  
reserves (49 for each player) distributed equally at the start of the game into  
seven pits. When one of the players loses all his/her shells, then s/he is  
nakibbutan . The road to  nakibbutan  is always preceded by one of the players  
having empty pits. Each pit must always contain seven shells or stones at the  
start of every round. If one player lost even just one shell to the competitor, s/he  
will have one empty pit called  puor , fire (or gutted by fire). I found the wife&#39;s use  
of the idiom of a game to describe her family&#39;s situation, and by extension her  
efforts at financial management, suggestive of how she had to deal with outside  
forces over which she had very little control or influence and also of the ways by  
which she can distribute her &#34;shells&#34; in order to protect her house from being  
nakibbutan  (emptied) and ultimately gutted by fire. [ 40 ]
I do not intend to overstate the advantages of my coming from San Gabriel nor  
do I wish to downplay the advantage and vantage point it has afforded me.  
Shared culture made it instinctive for me to negotiate interview appointments with  
women when they, particularly those with young children, would be most and  
least busy. This minimized the &#34;inconvenience&#34; of the interviews because they  
were plotted around their time. There obviously was not only a good time, but  
also a right time, to do things and this is socially and culturally determined (see,  
for example, PERTIERRA, 1997). I tried to make myself as least intrusive as  
possible, bearing in mind that they were doing me a big favor. [ 41 ]

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
In relation to my consideration of a &#34;culturally-informed&#34; temporality, the spatiality  
of my interviews was informed by a system of negotiating the world held by  
people who were assisting me. A number of middle-aged and older women  
advised me to be extra careful when interviewing in certain villages as,  
purportedly, many  mannamay  (roughly, witches) lived there. I was never to go  
there on Fridays as this was when they were most powerful and that if I went, I  
should bring with me a  pauli , a sort of amulet or protection. This mattered to my  
research because one of the women who was to accompany me to a village to  
introduce me to the wives I wanted to interview there taught for a number of years  
in the village&#39;s elementary school and believed herself to have been a victim of a  
mannamay . There was no way she was going there on a Friday. This  
sociocultural system of apprehending and negotiating the world, of which,  
incidentally, women are the bearers and transmitters, was drawing me into an  
&#34;imagined&#34; community in which some members were seen as suspect. In other  
words, there were insiders who were at the same time treated as outsiders  
precisely because they threatened the well-being of others. The issue here is not  
so much that I do not believe in  mannamay  as that this system enforced a  
temporality and spatiality on my research built on the temporality of the potency  
of these  mannamay . Although an outsider to this particular sociocultural system  
of apprehending the world built around these  mannamay , I nonetheless  
temporarily operated within and through it, inasmuch as it guided the way those  
assisting me in my research navigated San Gabriel&#39;s physical, social, and  
spiritual environment. [ 42 ]
The way I negotiated my relationships with the participants, how I interacted with  
their husbands and relatives, and my analysis of the interviews and observational  
data made full use of my linguistic fluency and access to the history, culture and  
sensibilities of the people. As GUTMANN (2002, p.38) has written on this matter: 
&#34;Interpreting and explaining cultural and individual feelings, attitudes, and practices is  
a dicey business that takes more than mere linguistic fluency in a language. Rather, it  
requires cultural fluency to be able to contextualize the words, inflections, and  
nuances, to distinguish kidding from kvetching.&#34; [ 43 ]
Yet my research in San Gabriel made clear to me the limits of my insiderness. In  
some ways, my fieldwork was the time for me to get to know San Gabriel more  
and my tricycle rides to villages I had never been to before provided me with a  
way to imagine and experience a small slice of the women&#39;s lives and their  
concerns. As one interviewee said, she and her children went to Sunday mass in  
the capital city, some 12 kilometers away from where she lived because the fare  
was cheaper than that to San Gabriel&#39;s Roman Catholic Church, less than five  
kilometers away. Because her village is not frequented by tricycles, she would  
have had to hire one for 60 pesos. But because the village is close to the national  
highway (motorway or autobahn), she can take a  jeepney  (a form of public  
transport) or a bus coming from other towns and that pass through San Gabriel  
and for which she would have had to pay only 30 pesos. [ 44 ]

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
While I had always thought that fare was determined by proximity or distance, this  
particular wife&#39;s experience showed otherwise. It also revealed that although she  
was closer to San Gabriel&#39;s  poblacion  (where the town center and Roman  
Catholic Church are located) than to the province&#39;s capital city in terms of  
physical distance, the  poblacion  was in fact less accessible. Where my  
interviewees lived helped me understand better their quotidian lives as it put into  
relief some of the daily concerns, like the availability or affordability of public  
transportation, which they had to contend with and that people who lived in the  
poblacion  did not have to or simply took for granted. Where they lived  
consequently acquired much more importance to my research than I had initially  
recognized as it alerted me to such issues as geographic marginality. My prior  
ignorance of the impact of where women lived on their lives, especially transport  
mobility, which had financial implications, is not due to class or economic status.  
It has to do with where we lived: I lived in the town&#39;s  poblacion  (&#34;urban&#34; center  
where the seat of local government, the public market, and the Roman Catholic  
Church are located). Residence in the  poblacion  does not equate to a higher  
economic status. It almost always means proximity to government, commercial,  
educational (especially secondary), and religious institutions. The proximity of  
where I lived to these institutions meant that the experiences of some of the  
women related to their spatial distance from these institutions (and the activities  
they embodied) were alien to me. Even as a &#34;native&#34; of San Gabriel, I had and  
continue to have experiences that are, to borrow from GEERTZ (1973), near to  
and distant from those of others from San Gabriel. They have been important to  
my capacity for reflection, to my capacity to step back in order to see things more  
critically and to disabuse myself of common-sense assumptions. [ 45 ]
3.5 Narratives and the burden of representation
In linking the personal and the political, I relied on women&#39;s narratives of their  
experiences: their descriptions of their routine and quotidian lives; the practices  
that sustain their families and their ties with other significant people; the  
difficulties they face, endure and try to overcome; as well as the hopes and  
aspirations they have pinned on migration. These narratives have been  
profoundly insightful, enlightening and moving, and they have made it possible to  
give a richly textured account of the nature and experience of what it is to live and  
sustain a family in the context of the alternating absence and presence of their  
husbands and other social and economic conditions they have to deal with. [ 46 ]
These narratives, however, are limited and partial, and their telling motivated  
(ABU-LUGHOD, 1993). First, there were aspects of the women&#39;s experiences  
that simply were &#34;unspeakable,&#34; that is, they were too private, intimate and  
sometimes painful to talk about. Second, they were the product of a specific  
interaction between a researcher and a participant. The reflections and narratives  
this interaction engendered were made at a specific point in the lives of the  
women thus providing perspectival accounts of their experiences. Third, the  
meaning and salience these narratives came to take no doubt was shaped by my  
own &#34;partiality.&#34; How I made sense of them was informed by my own set of  
experiences, perspectives, biases and, not least of all, my position within the  
FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
research. Their narratives have therefore been framed by my own critical  
interpretation of their life projects. However, in analyzing the women&#39;s narratives,  
I endeavored to situate the women, their experiences and what they said in their  
material, familial, social, religious, cultural, historical and economic contexts. [ 47 ]
This attempt to understand them in context constituted the reflexivity that I hope  
always attended and informed my representation of these women. My account,  
indeed, narrative, of how these Filipino seamen&#39;s wives navigated their lives is  
based on these stories that they shared with me. The spatio-temporal dimensions  
I identify and discuss as critical to and constitutive of their gender identity, agency  
and subjectivity are based on these narratives supplemented by observations and  
my momentary occupation, sharing and inhabitation of some of their physical-
social spaces. So is my examination of their negotiation of these spatial and  
temporal dimensions. Narratives were therefore central to my study in two ways.  
One, they constitute the empirical basis of my study. It is through how the women  
described their lives that I examined the spatio-temporality of their experiences.  
Narratives lend themselves to this undertaking for, as SOMERS (1994, p.616)  
has written, they are &#34;constellations of  relationships  (connected parts) embedded  
in  time and space. &#34; Two, narratives were crucial to how the women made sense  
of their experiences, that is, they provided the women with a way to locate  
themselves in time and space. It was through narratives that they expressed how  
they understood and saw themselves in relation to their &#34;past, present and  
imagined future&#34; (HENRIQUES, HOLLWAY, URWIN, VENN & WALKERDINE,  
1998, p.xiii). As SOMERS and GIBSON (1994, pp.58-59) have argued, &#34;it is  
through narrativity that we come to know, understand, and make sense of the  
social world, and [...] that we constitute our social identities.&#34; [ 48 ]
Here, Mary STEEDLY&#39;s notion of &#34;narrative experience&#34; is useful &#34;to evoke the  
ways that stories and experience are coproduced in everyday life&#34; (FAIER, 2009,  
p.82). FAIER explains that for STEEDLY &#34;stories do not simply express life  
experience; they are themselves lived out, structuring imaginations and assuming  
flesh and quotidian form&#34; (FAIER, 2009, p.82). For STEEDLY, narratives are  
&#34;part of the ongoing, dialogic, and constrained ways that people selectively make  
and remake the past as they craft lives and selves in the present&#34; (FAIER, 2009,  
p.82). My own research would show that how the women experienced their  
present and saw themselves was profoundly informed by their consideration of  
their future. Their present was inextricably bound up with the horizon. [ 49 ]
In relation to this, I wrote my discussion of the accounts and narratives of these  
women in the &#34;ethnographic past&#34; (RUTHERFORD, 2003) to clearly indicate their  
partiality and particularity. This is not to say that they are no longer true and that  
the problems and issues no longer obtain in their lives. It is to point out that what  
was said represents a particular way in which the women&#39;s experiences were  
apprehended and represented linguistically and affectively, and the particularity of  
the way I have interpreted and conveyed them in the thesis, a way that can only  
be seen to demonstrate the &#34;deeply perspectival nature of cultural knowledge&#34;  
(PELETZ, 1996, p.35) and that, as James CLIFFORD (1986) has noted, all  
ethnographies can only present &#34;partial truths&#34; (see also FARMER, 2005). It also

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
registers the specific, that is, research, context in which these accounts were  
generated and by the specific group of people I interviewed: wives/mothers. My  
use of this ethnographic past is also in recognition of the certainty that as these  
women move on with their lives, they will be engaged in a process of  
reinterpreting their life narratives. What they shared with me was but one  
instance of this process, a process I had helped to put in motion. [ 50 ]
Finally, the narrative analysis I did looked at how these women&#39;s narratives might  
be linked to Philippine history and its economic and political conditions (see  
MISHLER, 1999; WHOOLEY, 2006). This was not to revert to a form of  
functionalism or determinism. My strategy took the narratives of these women&#39;s  
experiences of migration as useful frames for thinking about how the country&#39;s  
economic and social conditions, and the state policies obtaining from them, are  
reshaping the lives, desires, and aspirations of Filipinos. In other words, these  
narratives were crucial not only in these women&#39;s understanding of, and  
positioning of themselves within, the labor migration of their husbands. Equally  
critical, they were important for braiding the personal and the political, for  
enabling the possibility of looking at these women who are not the migrant  
workers themselves as central to migration. My narrative analysis moved from a  
thematic analysis of the personal stories of these women to an examination of  
how their stories might be linked to the social and economic condition of the  
Filipino nation.  The analysis therefore sought to politicize, that is, make more  
political, their experiences (and not limit them as merely personal) since much of  
what they are going through is linked to, if not the direct consequences of, the  
limited social and economic possibilities in the Philippines .  [ 51 ]
4. Conclusion
In the context of this discussion of representation, here I wish to address more  
explicitly some thoughts about studying one&#39;s community. Questions have been  
raised about doing home ethnography (BACA-ZINN, 1979; ZAVELLA, 1997) and  
the critical issue for me, following LOIZOS (1992), is that I am able to remain  
adequately aware of my position in the society and culture where I conducted my  
study as well as in the issues I investigated. This is not so much about being able  
to keep my objectivity as much as it is about being able to exercise what  
SCHEPER-HUGHES (2001, p.318) has called a &#34;highly disciplined subjectivity&#34; or  
what TURNER (1975, p.8) referred to as &#34;an objective relation to one&#39;s own  
subjectivity.&#34; Of equal importance is the quality of the relationships I had with my  
participants (see NARAYAN, 1993) which influenced the quality of our interaction  
and their sharing of their stories. Nevertheless, I have always borne in mind that  
my interaction with the participants was based on &#34;ethically and emotionally  
fraught relationships&#34; (RUTHERFORD, 2003, p.xx), ones that were acutely  
temporally and spatially limited (see also PELETZ, 1996). [ 52 ]
One ethical issue of studying my own people or society, one that I grappled with  
most particularly after the fieldwork, is the sense of accountability I felt I had not  
only to the women and their families but also to San Gabriel. As ZAVELLA (1997,  
p.43) has written of this predicament: &#34;[a]long with the cooperation engendered  
FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/

FQS  16(3), Art. 13,  Roderick G. Galam : Gender, Reflexivity, and Positionality 
in Male Research in One&#39;s Own Community With Filipino Seafarers&#39; Wives 
by one&#39;s insider status comes the responsibility to construct analyses that are  
sympathetic to ethnic interests.&#34; Because many of the stories I had been  
privileged to hear were very sad, I thought about what sort of San Gabriel is going  
to be represented and what sort of stereotypes of the Philippines held by  
outsiders would this representation be taken to somehow affirm (cf.  
CRAPANZANO, 1985; SCHEPER-HUGHES, 2000, 2001). Although I was fully  
aware, and remain fully aware, of the non-generalizability of my findings and that  
readers would be critical enough to see this, the fact is that it led me to think  
more seriously about how I was going to use the data, about how I was going to  
write, about representation. BACA-ZINN (1979, p.218) has argued that such  
dilemmas &#34;serve to remind us of our political responsibility and compel us to carry  
out research with ethical and intellectual integrity.&#34; [ 53 ]
The ethical obligation that underpins the question of representation I am  
highlighting here raises an ethical consideration that specifically concerns the  
research after the fieldwork has been conducted. Janet FINCH (1984, p.82) has  
pointed out that ethical considerations &#34;tend to focus upon the point of access or  
of data collection rather than upon the use of the material.&#34; FINCH, as a feminist  
sociologist, was concerned about the potential for information given by women to  
be used &#34;against the collective interests of women,&#34; a concern that resonates with  
that expressed by BOURGOIS (1995) and NADER (1972) on the poor. Although  
it might be argued that the issue of representation with which FINCH is  
concerned involves people other than the researcher and the participants (for this  
involves the reception and use by other people of such representation), the  
substantive point she makes concerning the focus of research ethical  
considerations is relevant here. My study flags the issue of how to represent, for  
example, other women, specifically mothers-in-law, who are implicated in the lives  
of the women I interviewed. How do we go about representing people who are  
part of other people&#39;s lives but whose own versions or accounts are not sought? I  
argue that providing socio-cultural and economic contexts to, for example, the  
sources of conflict between the daughters-in-law and the mothers-in-law would  
help minimize the injustice that might be committed against people who are not  
thereby sought to speak for themselves. What I have done, particularly in the  
context of conflicts between the wives and their mothers-in-law, was to examine  
the cultural and economic contexts of these conflicts. The dilemma I faced led me  
to take a more socio-historically and culturally contextual approach to my  
analyses, which helped me locate the women and their relationships within  
material and social practices. Although the result may be an unflattering picture of  
people, place, etc., I have provided a means by which they could be better  
appreciated or more fairly judged. In doing so, my analysis did not rely upon, and  
hopefully did not reproduce, prejudicial representations of mothers-in-law (see  
BROWN, 1997, 2004). In doing so, I think (or hope) that I have also positioned  
myself in relation to the women and to the data in ways that have not been  
prejudicial to them and made my research the better for it. [ 54 ]

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen: Pugad Baboy
as a Case of Subversion and Renegotiation
in Philippine Comedy
Maria Rhodora G. Ancheta
WHY “PUGAD BABOY”?
To write about a comic strip that appears in a national daily six
times a week, together with 12 other strips, 52 weeks a year seems to
be an act that makes permanent the fleeting. There seems to be a
dual reality hovering over this seemingly innocuous reading fare (or,
for some, reading staple).  It is true that its daily publication and its
ver y popularity has made it so visible as to render it “tame,” seen now
as “naturally-occurring” in a mediascape that the average Philippine
reader takes on as casually as coffee and pan de sal for breakfast.  The
comics’ ephemeral nature is attributable to the fact that its three-to
four-panel narrative is one that changes daily, its continuity (and ABSTRACT
This paper discusses Pol Medina, Jr.’s contemporary comic strip
Pugad Baboy as a case of subversion and renegotiation undergone by
Philippine comedy. This paper posits that Medina’s innovation by way of
the “novelization” of the comic strip, as exemplified here by “Ang Hiwaga
ng Dueñas” (“The Dueñas Mystery”) from Pugad Baboy 4, illustrates
and inscribes what can be deemed as comic interpretations of the gaps,
distortions, and juxtapositions within Philippine culture. The reading of
this contemporary Philippine comic strip leads us to examine abnormality,
incongruity, inversions, and hyperreality as manifestations of current
Philippine comedy, one that may be socially corrective, or culturally
liminal, which now moves towards a depiction of comic postmodernity.

sur vival) depending on this quotidian development; hence this ver y
change adumbrates, too, the value of its stor y line.  By the next release
of this narrative production, the stories that have been read previously
go by the board—they are forgotten; only the characters remain.
The temporariness of comics also rests on the perception that
it is “a low brow form of entertainment” (Inge 35), “mass culture . . .
that is a hopelessly commercial culture, produced for mass consumption,
its audience . . . a mass of non-discriminating consumers . . .  formulaic
. . . a culture associated with brain-numbed, and brain-numbing
passivity” (Storey 10; my italics).  Because of this, it becomes reasonable
that one’s attention be caught only fleetingly by comics’ presence only
as one is actually reading it, and it becomes acceptable that this be
conveniently relegated to the background of a million other messages
pushed for ward by media and by popular culture as soon as contact
with it ceases.
It is this “popularity” that makes for the other half of this reality.
The fact is that this comic strip is not only a daily strip now.  It has,
like most of its Western counterparts, spawned the requisite consumer
merchandise—t-shirts, mugs, figurines, comic digests—not only
making it ubiquitous, but also engraving its presence within the
culture that created it.  More than the peripheral merchandising which
extenuates the representations of Pugad Baboy, a more significant
gauge of the popularity of the strip is its compilation into book form,
which at present is already on its twelfth collection. These
compilations signal several implications unto the strip.
First, it obviously marks the success of Pugad Baboy as an
accessible comic form, now made even more so by the fact that its
publication makes it wholly memorable. Strips that had been
previously read in the comics page are re-released.  Strips that were
other wise missed by the reader, as their presence is dependent on the
consumption of another reading matter (the newspaper), are now
made available, “virtually” for the first time.  This, again, impinges
on the innocuous nature of this collectivization.  We appreciate the
humor in the strip by way of several entries into it.  For those for whom
it is part of a daily reading fare, the collection is—as I earlier indicated
it to be—an exercise in memor y, and the pleasure of recapturing this
memor y of the text, in addition to the pleasure of recommencing or
recasting the moment of laughter, the moment of the comic.   A “strange

Ancheta
58  
impulse” here is that the collection as merchandise also depends on the
cache of the name/title to evoke the comic, which leads probable
readers to purchase each collection, which for many become their
introduction to this text. Even if initially serialized, the collection of
strips into book form (now divided into chapters) influence, too, the
narrativization of the form. What were once viewed as individual
strips, complete in themselves as a daily text, have now become part
of a larger plot, its daily encapsulation glossed over.
It is against this backdrop that I am reckoning with the creation
of comedy in the Philippines, and comedy that is Filipino, as presented
by this strip.  I am taking a chapter from Pugad Baboy 4 (1993), “Ang
Hiwaga ng Dueñas” (“The Dueñas Mystery”), which is the highlight
of this collection. The decision to work on this particular chapter
springs from the fact that the popularity—and the novelty—of this
contemporar y comic strip owes a lot to the author/artist’s adoption of
innovative stor y-telling techniques, such as this “novelization,” which,
while sustaining reader interest over a period of time, not normally
employed by other Philippine strips that may deal with similar
domestic settings, succeeds too in its sustenance of the joke encoded
in the daily strips.  Another reason for the choice of this text is Pol Medina’s
own citation of this stor y as his best, in a list he compiled for Pugad
Baboy X, in celebration of the tenth year of Pugad Baboy’s publication
(45).  The phenomenal rise in the popularity of Medina’s strip over
the past twelve years could be traced to the comic devices he employs
in it, which ranges from low humor to the employment of wit and
satire.
The concern of this paper is to take note of the interstices of
the creation of comic strip comedy in the Philippines, as well as the
nature of the comedy inscribed in it, in which Medina’s work is seen
not only as a contemporary example but is considered to be one whose
narrativization offers new and compelling insights into the aspects of
comedy that is Filipino.  The question may well be “What makes this
comedy Filipino?” or, “Is it truly Filipino?” More significantly, although
the examination of Pugad Baboy as contemporar y comedy is relevant,
so too is the interpretation of its gaps, distortions, anticipations, and
juxtapositions that invest it with its comic value, as much as these clarify
the value of this discourse as “specific point-of-impact text in the form of
a social practice or media message through which the culture expresses
itself and from which we create interpretations” (Real 21).

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
59  
THE PIG’S NEST
Pugad Baboy by Pol Medina, Jr. is a daily comic strip that has
appeared in the Philippine Daily Inquirer since 1988.  Larr y Alcala, a
veteran Philippine cartoonist, says: “Pol belongs to a new breed of
cartoonists but whose meteoric rise to popularity has to be matched.
This can be attributed to his distinctive style of drawing and down-
to-earth Filipino humor, with a dash of sophistication”(PB 4). We
note here, certainly, the presence of other cartoon strips that have made
an impact on the cultural landscape of the Filipinos—continuing
strips which center on personalities, such as Alcala’s own Asiong
Aksaya, Siopawman, or Kalabog (which later became Kalabog en
Bosyo); Tony Velasquez’s Ponyang Halobaybay, Nanong Pandak, or the
better-known Mga Kabalbalan ni Kenkoy (The Antics of Kenkoy), his
classic portraiture of the sporting, English-“spokening” Filipino; Roni
Santiago’s comic depiction of office relations in Baltic and Co., or
Nonoy Marcelo’s satirical take on Marcos-era politics in Tisoy and
later in Ikabod Bubuwit were also landmark works.  However, earlier
strips that focused on family and community life in the Philippines,
as Medina’s Pugad Baboy does, based its humor mainly on illustrations
of comic grimaces and facial distortions that accompanied depictions
of physical or verbal putdowns, or were responses to situational chiding
and chivvying in a domestic setting, as seen in Mars Ravelo’s  Buhay
Pilipino and later in his Gorio at Tekla and Rita (later known as Rita
Okay and Rita Rits). (See Roxas and Arevalo.)
In Pugad Baboy 4, Jess Abrera, editorial cartoonist of the Inquirer,
who is credited with the acceptance of Medina’s work in the Inquirer,
refers to Medina’s humor as “fresh.” In the second collection (actually
the first, entitled The Best of Pugad Baboy), Abrera had already
elaborated on the quality of this “freshness”: “we enjoy Pugad Baboy
because we recognize in its characters, if not ourselves, then our
siblings, neighbors, friends, offspring, and—patay kang baboy ka—
our politicians. In Pugad Baboy, the irritating, the vexing, the horrifying
among the people we know encounter each other, and their meeting
is always hilarious” (Medina  3; my translation).  Indeed, what Alcala
and Abrera are citing is Medina’s unflinchingly direct assault on
Filipino quirks and faults, the hilarity of his obser vations and
depictions often masking the incongruous and the almost surreal
aspects of Filipino traditions, relationships, politics, or culture. In
stretching his stor y-telling technique to include long-running comic

Ancheta
60  
“novels” based on complex plots and subplots, he gives us a medium
that is able to sustain these characterizations beyond the constraint
of the three to four panel strip.  Again, Medina is by no means the first to
explore or comically depict these aspects of the Filipino psyche.
Indeed, Soledad Reyes in her essay on Philippine komiks cited how
the “foibles of the age, its fashion and lifestyle, and the inevitable
clash between tradition and modernity” were exhibited by earlier
komiks writers in their works (48). However, she too assents to the
fact that these early komiks were a “pur veyor of halakhak, or raucous
laughter and down-to-earth humor” (48). Daisy Cukingnan and
Agnes Go in their essay entitled “Komiks: Isang Pagsusuri” cited
Bandenada’s (1955) attempt to classify Filipino komiks, stating that
these fall under two categories: the first, which possesses plot, and
the second, which aims merely to evoke laughter (125; my translation).
It is this second point that was expanded by Florendo when he asserts
the following:  
Mababa ang lebel ng pagpapatawa ng mga Pilipino komiks. Hindi
na tayo kailangang mag-isip pa upang makuha ang katatawanan
[sic] ibig ipahayag ng sumulat, hindi tayo nahihikayat gamitin
ang ating natatagong kaalaman . . . dahil dito sa atin nadapa ka
na ay pagtatawanan ka pa . . . (qtd. in Cukingnan and Go 125)
(There is a low level of comedy in Philippine komiks. We are
not required to think to get the humor intended by the writer,
[and so] we are not moved to use our latent knowledge . . . for
here, even falling flat on one’s face is an occasion for laughter.)
And this is where I believe Medina’s strip moves away from simple
depictions of universalized comic situations, marked by the low humor
of pratfalls.  While he does not shun the use of this, his consistent chronicle
of the daily life of the Philippine middle/lower middle class and the
juxtapositions he creates vis-à-vis certain facets of existing microcultures,
for example, make Pugad Baboy not only readable but cutting-edge
relevant.  Where the earlier comics writers (whether in newspapers or in
magazines) were seen to retain this level of low humor in the comedy
they created because of their fear that the ordinary reader would not
comprehend anything more complex (Cukingnan and Go 125), Medina
in Pugad Baboy is able to address wide-ranging cultural issues precisely
because he assumes in his readers a more than cursory knowledge of
science, popular culture, local and international politics, economics,

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
61  
language, or current events. Such knowledge is appended too to the
medium whereby we have access to his texts or to the socioeconomic
imperatives of the production of this text.
“Pugad Baboy” refers to a fictional urban middle class
subdivision whose inhabitants are, for the most part, fat people; hence
the reference to baboy (pig). Even their names bear references to
“piggishness” or to girth—the Sungcal family (sungkal: a Filipino
word meaning “to root around,” to use one’s snout to look for food in
the mud, as pigs do): Mang Dagul (Adagulfo), his wife Cecilia (Sweet
Ham), their children Kules (for Hercules), Tiny, and Utoy, and lest
we forget, their “talking” dog Polgas, later known as Wisedog/
Dobermaxx/Robin Hound/Aqua Pol, his hidden personas, around
whom Medina chose to develop several others of his “novelizations.”
Their household help, Brosia, is the only regular character who is
skinny in this strip, her role being that of the comic antithesis, the
provider of that particular form of Filipino humor called “asar,” which
may be seen as a form of truly personalistic comedy, which indeed
Brosia provides in these strips, her quips and one-liners often focusing
on the emphasis on the Sungcals’ size and weight or on puncturing
Bab’s ego by harping on his indolence and lack of looks. Their
neighbors/friends are colorfully named: Sgt. Sabaybunot (Quick
Draw), a soldier, his wife Barbie, and their son Paltik (meaning a
small, inferiorly made gun); Ka Noli, an urban NPA guerilla, and
his son Joma; Bab, who is the resident laggard and who is aptly
surnamed Lamon (Tagalog word meaning to snarf, to wolf food
down). They even have the token mechanic Joboy, the Chinese
storekeeper Mao (as in Mauricio Tang) who has a gay son named
Pao (for Paulino), and the corrupt Senator Cabalfin, whose overblown
wife insists on being called “Madame.”
Reading the chapter “Ang Hiwaga ng Dueñas” is to enter a
reassembly of 52 strips (nearly nine weeks of daily publication), which
now appear as a comic narrative.  “Jokes are a form of narrative,” J. Hillis
Miller avers, and “narratives are a relatively safe or innocuous place in
which the reigning assumptions of a given culture can be criticized
(66, 69). Admittedly, the valuation we assign here is not on the
narrative itself, which remains pretty simple, and is at most a
contrivance of subplots. Narrative here is at the ser vice of comedy,
and beyond the funny, our attempt too is to focus on the “criticism of
culture” that Hillis Miller advances.

In these strips, we find the Pugad Baboy characters on a vacation
trip to Dueñas. They stay with Mang Danilo, a faith healer whom
we learn cured Bab of his dependence on marijuana. While in
Dueñas, the characters meet with rural adventures, mostly related to
the presence of supernatural beings.  They get into a tussle with these
beings, culminating in Pao’s abduction and his rescue by the whole
Pugad Baboy who vanquish the monsters.  They find out that Mang
Danilo, far from being a genial host, is the culprit, and he is punished
accordingly. The chapter ends with their return to their “normal”
life in Manila.
A rough categorization of the strips according to topics may
aid in cross-referencing our discussion of its humor later on.  These
are certainly not strict categories in that there are strips which may be
appropriately slotted under one or more classifications; in the same
manner, there are strips whose topics are not as clearly marked or
stated, and which largely function to continue the narrative or to link
the strip to the next narrative installment.  In our delineation of these
topics, we are presenting, too, topics about or against which the comedy
in this text revolves or is created. This classification is mainly a
thematic one, but such themes are considered in terms of discussions
of aspects of abnormality and incongruity as major comic devices in
this specific text and in Medina’s daily comic strips. They are
contextualized within the realm of the communal.  The utilization of
the supernatural in the stor y is more than just a narrative ploy; the
juxtaposition of tradition and technology, of urban/rural, metropolis/
countr y dichotomies is a dizzying underpinning of the textual and
contextual hyperreality found in the strip, a condition that is evident
in Medina’s narrative as it is a precluded assumption of his work.

We have, so far, made a case for the narrative of the comic strip.
M. Thomas Inge avers that we should not forget that “the stor y is told or
the daily joke made through the balance of narrative text and visual action
with a proper aesthetic balance between the two, that is, both the picture
and the words are essential to a full understanding of the meaning” (35).
This dual nature of comics certainly furthers the humor of the text, but
in this case, we, for the most part, specifically refer to the dialogue and
depend on the narrative as keys to a sedimented discourse that is
Philippine culture, as it also becomes explanator y of the “ambiguous”
comedy that we find difficult to categorize.  Our dependence on the strip’s
illustrations is limited to a characterization of these as adjuncts to the
comic implications of the workings of the dialogue or the narrative and
should not be seen as an evaluation of the merit of these as “art.”  Arthur
Asa Berger commented on this same predicament of relegating popular
culture forms to mere “documents” that are scrutinized for their social
or political content with no view to their aesthetic form or conventions.
But while emphasizing this, neither did he resort to a commentary on
the aesthetics of drawing; instead, he construes “artistic dimension” as
an amalgam of “graphic elements, use of language, and narrative
structure” (155).
We should not construe this, conversely, to be an absence of
the text vis-à-vis the presence of the image.
[I]mages rarely appear without the accompaniment of a linguistic
text of one kind or another . . . the text loads the image, burdening
it with culture, a moral, an  imagination . . ..  The connotations is
now experienced only as the natural resonance of the fundamental
denotation constituted by the photographic analogy and we are
thus confronted with a typical process of naturalization of the
culture. (Roland Barthes qtd. in Storey 82)

Ancheta
64  
Indeed, what we are looking for in Pugad Baboy are resonances
of Philippine culture, or what seem to be Filipino, as revealed by
comedy, embedded in the language and the narrative of the comic
strip, illuminated by its image.
THE HUMOR OF THE COMMUNAL
Perhaps another way to support the study of specific comic texts
such as Medina’s Pugad Baboy is to start with what Michael Real
asserts in Culture, Media and Identity, that the “popular” is now as
seriously studied in the same manner that high culture was analyzed
previously.  Quoting David Rowe, he defines popular culture as “an
ensemble of pleasurable forms, meanings, and practices, whose
constituents are neither static nor unambiguous, and which cannot
be insulated from the social processes and structures in which they
are imbedded” (31). Discovering these junctures at which these
“processes and structures” work, or influence the text is tricky.
[T]raditional ways of studying high culture give high value to
the concept of “distance”.  One dimension of this is the critical
distance between text and reader which is claimed to be
essential if the critic is to analyze the text objectively. To be
objective, critical readers have to distance themselves from their
specific social identities and become ideal, or universal readers.
In the analysis of popular culture, this approach works well in
uncovering the ideological norms embedded in the text, and in
identifying its unrealized potentials, but it needs complementing
by “insider” readings that are not distanced, but that trace the
intimacy between a reading and the social conditions in which it
is performed. (Fiske 333; my italics)
It is this balancing act between distance and intimacy that we
preser ve when we tr y to analyze any text, but I think much more so
when we interpret the processes and provenances of comedy, for as
Henri Bergson puts it “the comic does not exist outside the pale of
what is strictly human” (62), and it is this that makes it possible for
us to penetrate, and indeed, appreciate, the vagaries of humor.  The
“human” here is obviously referent not only to the species but to the
agglomeration of practices and institutions, relations, concepts, and
forms that we deem part of our culture, as the tendencies of comedy

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
65  
already refer to its social matrices.  A criticism of contemporar y popular
texts like Pugad Baboy, hitherto read only as “low brow” and expendable
fare, tries to “rescue” these texts from such ephemeral and inferior status,
and attempts to recontextualize these as revelator y of aspects of comedy
that is Filipino by way of a comprehension, too, of the logic (or, in this
case, the illogic) of the comic world laid down by the writer/artist.
The intimacy that John Fiske refers to in this definition of high
and low culture we parallel to Raymond Williams’ concept of
“structure of feeling.” 
. . . refer[ring] to what it feels like to be a member of a particular
culture, or to live in a particular society at a particular time . . .
it stretches seamlessly from the realm of the spirit to that of the
social order . . . encompass[ing] the formal political processes
and institutions of a society as well as its more informal ones
… includ[ing] the arts and cultural industries . . . , and at the
microlevel, the ordinary ways of talking, thinking, doing, and
believing . . .. (Fiske 8-9; my italics)
 The Filipino reader of Medina’s strip is able to stand both as the
object of this comic jesting as s/he engages in the same kind of humor, or
as the obser ver/judge of the efficacy of this comic rendering because s/he
is assumed to be that member that Williams delineates, one who
comprehends, and enters, the same social/cultural/political/personal
dynamics within a marked geography, one that is made mythical by
Medina, both in Pugad Baboy, and now in Dueñas, as imaginative and
“imaged” topography  that both thrives in , and belies, Philippine society.
At the same time, Bergson also states that “to produce the whole
of its effect, the comic demands something like a momentar y
anaesthesia of the heart.  Its appeal is to intelligence, pure and simple”
(64), hence anchoring “distance” on what earlier on, Freud had
asserted in his Jokes and the Unconscious:
the need to see combined into an organic whole . . . [the]  criteria and
characteristics of jokes [to] activity, relation, to the content of our thoughts,
the characteristic of playful judgement [sic], the coupling of dissimilar
things, contrasting ideas, ‘sense in nonsense’, the succession of
bewilderment and enlightenment, the bringing for ward of what is
hidden, and the peculiar brevity of wit . . .. (14)

Freud here laid down the ver y aspects of the comic that we
ought to track in this strip as comic text, and given these virtually
paradoxical paradigms, we evaluate the comic functions of Pugad
Baboy first in terms of what I see as its communal nature.  The title
itself refers to the collective and is already humorous.  The “pugad”
(nest) is composed not only of characters who interact by way of their
role within the narrative; these are no casual participants—they are
linked by their familial, personal, and communal bonds, which operate
not only on the level of the emotional but work by way of enforcing
and reinforcing the norms and concerns that “give and get clues and
hints about their group membership, attitudes, and background
knowledge. Much of this exchange of social data occurs through talk:
not just what they say, but how they say it” (Norrick 17).  The volley
of exchanges depends upon assumed knowledge of their meanings
within the Pugad Baboy community among the Pugad Baboy
characters, but the exchanges include us, the readers, too.  “Laughter
appears to stand in need of an echo, no matter how spontaneous it
seems, laughter always implies a kind of secret freemasonr y, or even
complicity, with other laughers, real or imaginar y . . . our laughter is
always the laughter of the group” (Bergson 64).
We note that the characters themselves are not laughing when
they engage in conversation; the conversation itself is not the joke.  It
is when we the readers read the exchange within the context of a
multiple world—our world, the Pugad Baboy world, and global
culture—do we “get the joke.”  The suspension at the end of a strip
is the unseen panel reser ved for the observer/reader’s laughter.  This
is our complicity in the humor of the strip. We laugh because we
ourselves are part of the pugad; we are ourselves inhabitants of the
“nest.”
This brings us, therefore, to the problem of identity within the
“group membership.”  Who are the “baboys” (pigs/piglets/swine) of
the Pugad? They are basically urban, middle class, educated, working
people—Dagul Sungcal is a hotel chef who has a son working as a
draftsman in Saudi Arabia (Kules), a daughter in college (Tiny), and
a “techie”-genius son (Utoy); Sabaybunot is an army soldier; the Tangs
(Mao and Pao) are merchants; Senator Cabalfin is a legislator who
really does nothing but play with toys, literally, and wait for
“kickbacks.” There are other characters we recognize as part of
this middle/lower-middle class: the spinster/elementar y teacher

67  
(Miss Nobatos), the corrupt policeman (Patrolman Dur ugas), and
the ignorant doctor (Doc Sebo); and those who almost defy the
boundaries of this class, the “unemployable” Bab and the NPA soldier
Ka Noli.  These characters subscribe to general Filipino beliefs and
customs as seen, for example, in their knowledge of the supernatural
folk belief in this chapter, and to institutionalized beliefs (vide the
function of Catholicism and Catholic beliefs in the resolution of this
narrative’s conflict, however per verted/subverted).  The Pugad Baboy
characters are held by the ideology of the Philippine middle class,
and what they consciously or unconsciously articulate are the concerns
of this class: that they are helpless/apathetic politically, hence this
group’s “retreat” to Duenas, presumably for a vacation, (see strip 1)
that they are not economically empowered (see strips 7 and 8), that
their “virtue” or strength is in the “goodness” they uphold by way of
community and their subscription to communal beliefs. Here we see
the manifestations of the Filipino middle class ideology.  Politically
and economically mobile, the consciousness of belonging, seen either

as camaraderie or conformity, is set as a premium here. To deviate
from this belonging is to merit punishment, which is what happens
to Mang Danilo, who turns out to be Devlino, the leader of the aswangs,
and the minion of “Lady Lucy” [Lucifer/the devil].  He is punished
twice and physically, too: first by Wisedog (Polgas, the Sungcals’ pet
dog), now assuming superheroic qualities, (a parody of the agent/
hero of a now-defunct American TV series Wiseguy), and by his master
(mistress?) and turned into a poisonous mushroom later on (see 41
and 46).  It is noteworthy, too, that it is Pao, among the Pugad Baboy
gang, who gets abducted by the werewolves in this narrative’s
complication.  I think Pao becomes expendable here not only because
it is guaranteed more laughs but because he himself is considered
deviant. Because he is gay, his separation from the group is made
justifiable, albeit presented as comic, and though he becomes catalyst
for group mobilization in the narrative (they all pull together to save
him), and his separation is temporar y (when he is rescued he is once
more “reabsorbed” into the group), he is marked by this separation.
He is detached from the group while still being part of it.  We add to
this too that the text’s “pretext” is that he is Chinese; he makes a case
for his own abduction by making himself equal to a ransom, but the
racist connotations of this are all too clearly comprehensible (see
strip 22).
However, he was, in fact, abducted because he was thought to be a
pregnant woman, fit for the aswang’s version of human “La Paz batchoy”!
The implications here are multifarious: the operating ideology becomes darker
by the frame—it is homophobic, racist, anti-women, and anti-fat, all at the
same time. The humor that surfaces, and that we appreciate here, echoes too
the definitions Raymond  Williams gives to the term masses:
Strip 22

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
69 Yet, masses was a new word for mob, and the traditional
characteristics of the mob were retained in its significance:
gullibility, fickleness, herd-prejudice, lowness of taste and habit. . . it
is necessar y to ask again: who are the masses? In practice, in our
society, and in this context, they can hardly be other than the
working people . . .. But if this is so, it is clear that what is in
question is not only gullibility, fickleness, or lowness of taste and
habit [but] as from the open record, the declared intention of the
working people to alter society, in many of its aspects, in ways by
which those to whom the franchise was formerly restricted deeply
disapprove . . .. (19l; my italics) 
The humor that the text uses overtly presents ridiculous situations
that “emphasize the incongruity of . . . life as a paradox—the simultaneous
existence of a mutually contradictory fundamental truth” (Collins 6).
However, the “fundamental truth” to which we desire to subscribe, we
usually deem innocuous, but is just as ambiguous.  What emerge here,
as in reality, are the “metanarrative/[s] that describe and define away the
respectable . . . working class”(Walkerdine 111; my italics).  If Bergson
can speak of  “social signification” in laughter, Valerie Walkerdine furthers
this sense of the “social” in terms of  the following:
imaginar y communities created . . . the [real] communities and
organizations which were their strength having been crushed . .
. we can[not] explore the constitution of this subjectivity without
examining how poverty, pain, oppression, exploitation, are made
to signify. The popular as escape, indeed: the longing, the hope .
. .. The practices in which subjects are produced are both material
and discursive, but the relation is not one of representation, but
signification. Indeed, if fictions can function in truth then fictions
themselves can have real effects. Subjects are created in multiple
positionings in material and discursive practices, in specific
historical conditions in which certain apparatuses of social
regulation become techniques of self-production. (111)
Pugad Baboy, being this imaginary community, subverts the
framing of Philippine realities by way of its humor, which becomes
the medium by which we are able to examine the “poverty, pain,
oppression, exploitation” that Walkerdine cites as primar y
characteristics of the real, parallel society ascribed to by this comic
strip. We laugh at and with this community because our interests

Ancheta

and identities are also inscribed within it. The variables of age affinity,
racial grouping, gender identity, class lines (cf. Real 31) are at one
and the same time expressed and abrogated within the matrix of this
community, where “community refers to the entirely informal
network constituted by fellow feeling, and joking is especially apt to
express this since it both mirrors the subversion of established patterns
and is based on pleasure . . . attack[ing] classification and hierarchy”
(Palmer 17).  This attack, though, does not necessarily end in the change
in hierarchy or authority; at least, this is not what we see in Pugad
Baboy.  In this specific chapter, there is a created hierarchy, the “class
structure” within the supernaturals’ enclave, where there are minions
under Devlino’s leadership.  We find funny the discover y of  Devlino/
Danilo’s plot and its overthrow by the “good” Pugad Baboy visitors.
The truth, though, is that the hierarchy to which the visitors belong
remains unchanged.  A further source of the comic here is that the
Pugad Baboy “heroes” are no heroes they are really just middle class
urban vacationers who, by happenstance, were embroiled in this
conflict. We see here too that the comic insults, the gross incongruities
and manipulations of one character of another, of the author of his
material, of the text over us, in one sense reclaims for the Pugad
Baboy folks a sense of power and control that they do not have in
their normal milieu.
Our Pugad Baboy inhabitants are rendered even more comic
because of the supplantation of their locale from Pugad Baboy in the
city to Dueñas in the countr y, from familiarity to strangeness (and
how!), from presence to anonymity.  This is perhaps why they needed
to be embroiled in an adventure in this provincial setting.  What is
apparent here is the underscore of their “middle-class-ness.” They
are ridiculously comic because the source of comedy is real incongruity,
“variations from the norm . . . and changes in normalcy”(Collins 7).
These are actually deviations and per versions that we run into in
reading the text, faced with juxtapositions of the normal—Pugad
Baboy characters and their inherent characteristics—and their
transport of these characteristics to an unknown milieu, in which
they do not really belong. Nevertheless, the humor that is created
arises from bringing their own milieu, and its subjectivities, and their
concerns in it, to this new locale.  They are urbanites aware of what
the small town has to offer but, now and again, run into situations
where they bring their urban culture to this rural context, with
unexpected results.  Strip 6 is a great example of this.

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
71 .    
Pektong Manghuhula (fortuneteller) is dismissed by Mang Dagul
as a fake as Sweet Ham, his wife, queues to avail of  his service.  Dagul’s
disbelief likely stems from the commonly held belief that there are
fortunetellers who are either impostors or who may genuinely be gifted
but choose to use these gifts as money-making schemes.  However, take
note of what Sweet Ham whispers: “His surname is Punongbayan,” and
in the last frame, we find Dagul in line even before Sweet Ham. This
joke would fall flat unless one knows that “Punongbayan” refers to the
respected volcanologist whose honesty and directness as head of the
Philippine Institute of  Volcanology restored confidence and authority in
government at the height of the Pinatubo eruption in 1991. Yet this strip,
in assuming the readers’ knowledge of these complex facts and relations,
is able to do so because it assumes, too, the urbanization of our knowledge,
as this rests on our access to media channels, in the same manner that in
presenting Dagul to be as “gullible” as Sweet Ham, makes him doubly
so: first, in believing the hype (true or otherwise) about Punongbayan,
and, secondly, in transposing this belief, simplistically, on to Pektong
Manghuhula.  An even more ludicrous aspect of this comes in strips 7
and 8: the unsaid accusations about the fakery of fortunetellers, which
we earlier delineated, turn out to be true! Pektong Manghuhula is as
inclined to business as we had earlier assumed, so much so that he resorts
to “haggling,” a ver y Filipino practice:
Dagul: “Magkano ba ang magpahula sa ‘yo?” (“How much to
have my fortune told?”)
Pekto: “Eight hundred lang.” (“Only 800 bucks.”)
Dagul: “Eight hundred pesos?! . . .  Ang mahal naman! (“800
pesos? . . . That’s so expensive!”)
Pekto: “Mahal na rin ang baterya ng cr ystal ball ko e.” (“Well,  my
cr ystal ball’s batteries are expensive too.”) (my translation) 
Strip 6

Ancheta
72  
In the strip, we see Dagul stand up and prepare to leave,
obviously dismayed and unconvinced by such exorbitant rates set by
Pekto.  The third panel sets up the punchline of this joke, with Pekto
amending his offer: “Hinde . . . sige 400 na lang . . . 200 . . . 100?” as
Dagul walks away.  In the last panel, Pekto catches up with Dagul
and stops him from leaving by holding on to Dagul’s leg, fawningly
stating his final come-on: “Singkuwenta pesos na lang. May libre pang
lollipop.”  Lowering his price to get Dagul’s and Sweet Ham’s custom
(with a “free lollipop” to boot) makes mocker y the staple of these
specific strips’ comedy.  The visual aspect of the strip is not lost on us
either. Pekto’s status as a possible fake healer/fortuneteller is
emphasized by his weird toga-like costume, “accessorized” with a
tiara and a pendant, perhaps to make him appear the possessor of
magical powers. His actions, however, belie such “mysticism” and
actually revert him to the status no better than a snake-oil peddler.
Another source of incongruity based on locale is the disparity
between the urban and the rural, and this is where we find humor
“aris[ing] in discrepant relationship between the two parts of
perception” (Palmer 95). The Schopenhauerian definition of
incongruity is also applicable here:
the mismatch between a concept and some empirical entity in
the world: concepts are necessarily universalizing, in the sense
that a concept groups together all the empirical instances that
fall under it in the world . . . when some empirical entity in the
world fails to behave according to the expectations set up by
the relevant concept, incongruity occurs. (95)
The rural here is itself a paradigm, which carries its connotations
of backwardness by virtue of absence: what is not in the city and what
is not the city.  However, what is incongruous is either the play between
the unexpected presence of objects/ideas in it or the failure of the
paradigm to behave in the expected manner.  Again, good examples
to cite here are strips 8 and 11. In strip 8, the last thing we would
expect to find in a rural medicine man’s hut is a photocopying
machine, much less to have it used to make reproductions of an
amulet, again playing with the “haggling” theme so familiar in a
Philippine wet market setting, now applied to the “business” of the
mystical. Pekto plays on Sweet Ham’s gullibility by “predicting” a
misfortune that would happen to her in Dueñas, only to be able to

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
73  
ply his bogus wares: “Ang tanging makapagliligtas sa iyo ay itong
mahiwagang panyolito na may hiroglipikong Latin!” (“The only thing
that could save you is this magical handkerchief with Latin
hieroglyphs!”) (my translation), this pronouncement accompanied
by an illustration of lightning sizzling in the background, an obvious
parody of the formula of third-rate horror movies. Pekto quotes a
price of a thousand pesos for such an amulet, but Sweet Ham pleads
that she has only  three hundred pesos.  Pekto agrees to this, but we
find that Sweet Ham’s  money can buy  only a  photocopy of the “magic
handkerchief.”  An even bigger comic milieu here is Pekto’s fortune-
telling run as though it were a legitimate “corporate” concern,
complete with an “office assistant” (“Gor ya, I-xerox mo nga sandali
ito.”  [“Gor ya, will you come and have this “xeroxed”?]).
Strip 11’s humor is by way of word play mainly, but is an
interesting set-up to this: Dagul and his dog Polgas are having a
drink in a Dueñas bar, and Dagul orders a “77” (Seagrams’   
7 with  7-up
[ginger ale]).  Polgas is naturally surprised: “Meron pala sila dito niyan?”
And Dagul explicitly says that “just because it’s a small town is no
reason for them not to know what a 77 is” (my translation). Once
ser ved, Dagul spits out the concoction, having been served the
Filipino herbal tea  pito-pito (7-7).
I think the question here is not so much why these are comic but
why we should assume such disparity in the first place.  So they have a
xerox machine, why shouldn’t they? Why should Polgas be “naturally”
surprised at finding an imported liquor brand being ser ved in the province
or that rural folk know what this drink is? We laugh because we, as
Filipino readers, share as much of this contradictory expectation. By
laughing at the humor presented here, we articulate in much the same
way our agreement with the manner by which this “microuniverse” is
imaged, agreeing to consign the rural to a permanent condition of lack.
Perhaps we should note here that a ver y significant aspect of
the presentation of these incongruities is based on the use (or misuse)
of language by Medina. We have previously encountered an aspect of
this language use in the ver y names given to the characters who inhabit
Pugad Baboy, appellations which hint at clearly descriptive attributes
they possess, primarily hinting at size and weight, setting these
characters’ comic aspects (e.g., Dagul, Sweet Ham, Kules, Bab), or
clueing us in on the work they do (Sabaybunot, Patrolman Durugas,

Ancheta
74  
or Doc Sebo), while others are rendered humorous because these are
names that rely on a knowledge of Philippine realities (e.g., Ka Noli:
the title a usual form of respect and “Noli” hinting at the title of
Rizal’s novel, Noli Me Tangere; or Joma, Noli’s son, obviously a takeoff
on the Communist Party of the Philippines’ leader Joma Sison).
There are names, too, that figure in the ordinar y life of the Filipino,
however stereotypically: Joboy, or Mao and Pao. Also, wit is seen in
the exchanges that mark the way Pugad Baboy folk deal with each
other, characteristic too of the way Filipinos forge humorous
situations: that is, the rendering of every situation as a comic one by
way of deflating the seriousness of an episode by adding a quip or a
rejoinder that moves the situation away from its pathetic possibilities
and highlighting the incongruous or the ridiculous in the scene.  In
strip 3, for instance, we find Mang Danilo, the faith healer, explaining
to the Pugad Baboy group that he knew Bab as a hippie teenager
whom he cured of his LSD and marijuana addiction.  Tiny, Dagul’s
daughter, asks him when this happened. Mang Danilo replies—
“Noong late sixties . . . panahon ng Woodst . . . umf!”—but is unable
to finish his statement as Bab claps his hand over Mang Danilo’s
mouth. Tiny, Pao, and even Polgas, however, do not allow the occasion
to rib Bab to pass and, instead of focusing on the revelation of Bab’s
former addiction, concentrate on the humor of Bab’s age:
Tiny:“Bab! Teenager ka na pala noongpanahon ng ‘Woodstock’?”
Polgas: “Woooow.  Pehips.”
Pao (with accompanying swoon and peace sign with his
fingers): “Peace, man.”
Another way by which a conversation departs from its sobering
possibilities is for the characters to exhibit and to verbalize a conscious
awareness of the dramatic (or melodramatic) exaggerations of the
text, and makes the reader aware of this too, not unlike the
consciousness of the actor who speaks to the camera, showing an
awareness that s/he is merely acting.  This reflexivity, again, may be
seen as a ver y Filipino way of dealing with harsh realities, or with
unpalatable truths, being as it is an avoidance of seriousness and,
therefore, of the primar y impact of what is difficult to accept or what
is overtly unacceptable, thus making way for the stereotype that
Filipinos laugh at ever ything.  Witness this in strip 41:

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
75  
The gravity of Polgas/Wisedog’s vanquishment of Danilo/
Devlino has awful implications.  Not only does this reveal Devlino’s
role in the plot to decimate the Pugad Baboy folk, it is also a revelation
of Mang Danilo’s betrayal of the group and the group’s trust.  Polgas’
formulaic pronouncement in the third and fourth panels—“From
this day on, I will make sure that your reign ceases!” (my translation),
while delivering a jaw-cracking kick at Devlino/Danilo—is reduced
to that self-aware interior gaze that includes us in the last panel—
Polgas: “What a dialogue!,” Danilo: “Applause, people!,” where
neither Polgas nor Danilo show any sign of fatigue or pain—showing
too the unconnectedness of this panel to the previous ones,
approximating perhaps the disconnection from reality  that humor
offers the characters, or the persons involved, in a potentially grave
situation diffused by the introduction of the comic.
Medina’s use of language as a vehicle of his strip’s humor is
seen, too, in his use of very contemporar y forms of address and
emotions, (bru for bruha, bebe for baby, day for inday), the employment
of “swardspeak” in Lady Lucy’s (Lucifer’s) spiel: “imbiyerna ka talaga
Devlino . . . napilitan tuloy akong um-appear dito kahit na luma itong
gown koh!” (“You are such an annoying pest, Devlino . . . [because of
you] I was forced to appear even if all I have on is a really old gown!”)
(my translation), tsugi-tsugi (die!), baboo (goodbye), wa for wala (no/
none). Medina’s linguistic assumptions of his readers in this strip
range from the nearly vulgar to the sophisticated, but more than this,
Medina’s comic strip attempts to use language as a real medium for
humor that presents the quick repartee based on the formulations of
knowledge upon cultural realities, not now as a mere medium for
the logic or the continuity of the narrativized text that earlier komiks
are wont to employ, where conversational humor may be based on  
Strip 41

Ancheta
76  
the singular breakage of language (Kenkoy, Barok, Kalabog en Bosyo,
or even Ikabod Bubuwit, for example), but where the punch line relies
either on the literal or metaphorical pratfall, or on a “last panel”
humor that employs no language but usually uses the “surprised
silence” technique, where the joke is met by the character who falls
down in exasperation, or in stupefaction.
THE SUPER-NATURAL AND THE HYPERREAL
Another area of humor in this text is the presentation of the
abnormal, and a major part of this lies in the narrative’s assignment
of the folk belief in supernatural beings as the source of conflict.  This
appears to echo the “Filipino” milieu, but what I wish to raise is that
the supernatural here becomes fluidly interspersed with elements that
are not Filipino at all or that its presence as conflict is juxtaposed
against a solution that is not only urban but Western.  This is precisely
the point of its humor: that the reader is painfully aware of this text as
pastiche and, therefore, postmodern.
In strip 9, we start seeing the entr y of the rural “supernatural”
motif when Bab meets a pretty girl whom he finds out has never had
a boyfriend. This piques Bab’s interest, only to find out that this is so
because the girl’s mother is a mangkukulam (witch). Bab beats a
(truly) hasty retreat, leaving the girl by going through the hut’s flimsy
wall.  In strip 13, the same structure occurs, except that now it is Noli
and Sarge who meet a girl in a bar and are told that they could have
her company for half the price. They invite her to sit with them in
the apparent manner of gentlemen, again only to be told that she
would rather “float”—as she is a manananggal.  Strip 14 presupposes
the easy camaraderie among Filipinos—an exceptionally tall man
asks Dagul and Bab for a light for his cigarette. They tell him to join
the PBA (Philippine Basketball Association, the professional league
in the Philippines), setting ball players who are multimillion earners
as comparison. The punch line is a revelation that the man is a kapre.
In these preceding strips, the supernatural characters start off as being
no different from the Pugad Baboy characters. They, too, operate
within the same codes, but highlighting their difference (they are
not humans) not only provides the incongruity within the text, it
also signals the fact that they cease to share the codes to which they
earlier were privy. This is one implication of abnormality: that

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
77  
exclusion is the price one pays for being different, no matter how far
an entity has entered the realm of the dominant.
Another aspect of abnormality presented here is the supernatural
as a perversion of the body. We have seen this in strips 13 and 14, and
strip 16 is an even more bizarre instance of this.  Tiny, Dagul’s daughter,
and Pao, her gay friend, are excited over the arrival of what they think
is a really handsome young man, whose picture they were given.  They
were told that this young man has an identical twin, and when they
did arrive, the “twins” turn out to be a body with two heads.  This
humor is almost farcical, as is Bab’s hasty retreat discussed earlier, as
is the “floating” woman.  The reference to the near-scatological is
part of this per version; examples of these are strip 5’s depiction of
Bab’s socks used as “improvised katol” (mosquito coil) to kill the
“mosquitoes as big as dragonflies in Iloilo,” now “bloatedly” feasting
on the guests from Pugad Baboy (note the “burp” issuing from one
tiny mosquito in the first panel as it flies away after having bitten
Pao).  The stink of Bab’s socks is so potent that by the last panel, not
only were the mosquitoes killed, we see Dueñas folk, their animals,
even pests and rodents driven out of their homes and lairs because of
the odoriferous smell.  Strip 26 features urination humor, albeit an
“arrested” one, as Polgas/Wisedog, the “hero/savior” now tr ying to
track the kidnapped Pao, reverts back to his canine ways by marking
the trees with his scent.  This abruptly ceases as Polgas/Wisedog, who
raises his hind leg preparing to mark the trees with his urine, realizes
that we the readers are also marking him with our gaze—a decidedly
human, normative one. And so, in the end, such an animalistic,
“per verted” act is corrected by redoing the marking, this time with
Polgas blushing and drawing an “X” mark on the tree trunks instead.
The humor here is a play not only on word meanings (minarkahan—
marked) but also on the attribution of such meanings to human
contexts, one decidedly bodily and the other evidently social in nature.
The humor issuing from the presentation of the perverted,
grotesque body may be explained by this fact:   
the basic indignities of farce contradict some commonplace
expectation held by society for which farce is produced; in our
culture such an expectation would be closely related to the
traditional belief that the human body is the locus of dignity,
the dignity which is immanent to the human species, and that

Ancheta
78it ought to be treated in a way that is consistent with that sense
of dignity. Pratfalls, custard pies in the face, etc. all contradict
such a belief. (Palmer 45)  
The conquest of the supernatural beings and their eventual
banishment is superficially funny because it mobilizes the Pugad
Baboy folks to act as (super) heroes, a point we earlier raised.  Their
fatness is part of the farce here; the fact is that we see them as the least
likely heroes because their figure/s do not conform to the stereotypical
athletically-built strong-man/woman type, and we undoubtedly expect
them to fail because of this. But by conquering the monsters, they
have themselves become the super-natural: they have exceeded their
prescribed circumstances, however unlikely or impossible this is, and
have taken on the nature of winners, both in the sense of triumphing
over the Dueñas evil and in the sense of being empowered, of being
more than the suburban dwellers that they are.
I contend, too, that the basis of the humor in this conflict is the
presentation of this battle as hyperreality.  John Fiske clarifies the term:
Postmodern sense of the real . . . accounts for our loss of certainty
in being able to distinguish clearly and hierarchically between
reality and its representation, and in being able to distinguish
clearly and hierarchically between the modes of its
representation . . . the postmodern promiscuity of images
swamps any attempt to control them; it over whelms any neat
distinction between representation and reality, between fact
and fiction. (Media Matters 62)

This is why instead of horror as a response to this narrative, we
return a reply of laughter—either in amusement or in a knowing
mocker y of the spectacle of the text.  The way envisioned by Pugad
Baboy characters to overcome the “evil” enemies is to assume yet other
fictive characters (this time from film/cartoons), the Ghostbusters,
now called “Growlsbuster” as they are led by Polgas the dog.  Their
weapons are an urban per version of folk antidotes and remedies: garlic
powder, vitamin E capsules with garlic oil, Shakee’s [sic] garlic and
cheese pizza, all hinting at the artificiality of urban existence, the
commodification of the natural, as these are the forms in which the
natural is made available, or is recognizable, in the city.
A more interesting aspect of the presentation of the supernatural
here lies in the fragmented media multiplicities and Western concepts
interfacing with local beliefs, all creating a pastiche of a unified
“supernatural” image.  Local aswangs and tikbalangs exist side by side
with werewolves, gorgons, and zombies. The encounters between the
“good” Pugad Baboy folks and the horrible monsters are rendered
incongruous because of references to films, animation, politics, gossip
magazines, homosexuality, sports, cuisine, and ecological practices.
Let me focus on two or three strips here, specifically.  Strips 15 and 34
do ver y little to advance the development of this text’s narrative, but
their comedy stand as individual daily plots because of references to
the Count (of Sesame Street, a popular American children’s show)
and to the Ninja Turtles (from an animated cartoon show).  In strip 15,
the presence of the Count is a superficial reminder of the supernatural
battle in the text, but it is on many levels rendered ridiculous: the
vampire is not a Filipino concept; the Count as visually depicted takes
off from his role in the children’s program—whose function is to count;
he is not part of the actual tussle in the text, and what he is counting
is truly trivial, if not disgusting: five armpit hairs.  Here we see that
this juxtaposition again assumes knowledge of all these levels by the
audience/reader as it does, too, of the characters in the comic strip.
Yet the presentation of this plot elicits laughter without the
verbalization of these points. Strip 34 relies on the piggabangga scream
for its humor.  The Ninja Turtles, who are mutant turtle heroes, shout
“Cowabunga!” right before they enter the fray. Piggabanga rests on
this parallelism, but the term is self-reflexive, too, to the fact that they
are from Pugad Baboy (therefore pigs) and this becomes a shout
acknowledging, indeed celebrating, their difference, while

Ancheta
80  
appropriating the heroic stance of the cartoon heroes from whom they
borrowed this now per verted call-to-arms (in an orthographic sense
too). In strip 31, Mang Danilo purportedly saves Polgas from the
werewolves by waving what appears to Polgas as a white hanky, which
Polgas construes to be a protective amulet, only to be terrified himself
(as the werewolves earlier were) because the “amulet” is not now
one; instead, it is revealed to be a political banner with “Danding for
the countr y” on it.  Again, this strip obviously pokes fun at the current
melee of election advertising, which in turn devalues politics and turns
it into a media circus, as it is a personal stab against Danding
Cojuangco’s eligibility as president (being a corporate taipan, and
perceived to have practiced crony capitalism). This “ill” choice is
juxtaposed against the expected “good” magic inherent in the
presupposed magical object.  An even more ludicrous turn here is that
the named political candidate does not appear acceptable even to dogs
or that all he is good for is to scare folk away.  The weapons seen to
conquer evil are a weird mixture of the homemade, the modern, the
folk, and the apocr yphal, recast into weapons of near-apocalyptic
proportions. The garapata (tick) gun loaded with holy water, silver
forks against the werewolves, slingshots loaded with barbecue sticks
(after Polgas has eaten the barbecue), the horse’s jawbone that becomes
a boomerang that is a virtual homage to Batman are a comic arsenal
created as an amalgamation of the folk and the pop, therefore
illustrating what Lawrence Grossberg asserts about texts.   
[Texts] are not added on to already existing contexts (inter-
texts);  rather texts and contexts are articulated to each other,
each inserted into the other as it were . . . involv[ing] the
production of contexts, the ongoing effort by which particular
practices are removed from and inserted into different
structures of relationships, the construction of one set of
relations out of another, the continuous struggle to reposition
practices within a shifting field of forces. (43)
I see the prevalence of the hyperreal here as an attempt at
subversion, as it is an articulation of the disparate, even conflicting
realities in Philippine culture.  The resultant comedy here sublimates
societal concerns, and cultural constructions (now neo-constructions?)
offer a distancing gaze, on the one hand diffusing either the focus of
these concerns or trivializing them altogether.  But this distancing gaze
turns itself to the valorization of the Pugad Baboy folks, who continue

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
81  
the negotiation between the hyperreal world, carr ying in themselves
and in the milieu in which they are “this excess of high-speed
information . . . the superfluidity of information” (Morley 63). But
instead of a Baudrillardian refusal to arrive at meaning, Pugad Baboy
is still at that juncture where social reality is definable and limnable
from and by the text, thus this society’s concerns are continually
undermined, per verted, “its confusions and distortions encapsulated,
accentuated, reflected . . . ” (Strinati 424).
For what is the solution in this narrative? The Pugad Baboy
characters triumph over the evil Devlino, and ultimately over “Lady Lucy”
(Lucifer is portrayed as gay here)—who outrightly admits that “she” has
no power over them, not because of their weapons but because of their
“return to God.” This reversal back to the realm of the spiritual seems to
signal the “Filipino” belief, in this case, in a Christian-Catholic concept
of God.  Problematized here is the comic portrayal of a gay devil, who is
“tamed” and who becomes a trivialized evil. His resort to preying on
politicking electoral candidates establishes this “real” social evil but, at
the same time, strips it of any terrible national or personal consequence,
its morality accompanied only by “an absence of feeling which usually
accompanies laughter . . ..  Indifference is its natural environment, for
laughter has no greater foe than emotion” (Bergson 63).  Comedy works
not by expecting a direct examination of the discrepancies it raises but by
“confronting one relevant structure by another less clearly relevant, one
well-differentiated view by another independent one to which it does
not apply” (Douglas 303).  Therefore, the “serious themes” which run
through this comic narrative will continue to surface but will remain in
the drift, hoping that it produces the catch later on, not by bludgeoning
the reader on the head with it but by luring it into the seeming familiarity
of the waters, as though the net were not present.
CONCLUSION
In our analysis of Pugad Baboy, the answer to “what makes for
Filipino here?” is still without a definite answer. We have partly succeeded
in identifying certain realms of culture and society inscribed within the
matrix of its humor and the cultural form it takes. This indefiniteness is
not ambiguity. Comedy transfixes culture while relying on constantly
moving elisions, “the signifying elements . . . perpetually being
recombined and played off each other” (Nowell Smith 77).

On the one hand, the “Filipino” that is inscribed in Pugad Baboy
refers to a dominant culture that appears now to have reworked what
Reyes cites as “ the complex mixture of the folk and popular culture that
shapes and structures the komiks” (in her case, the komiks-magazine;
here, the comic strip) (48).  I refer to a reworking here, first, because the
milieu of this dominant Philippine culture, as seen in Pugad Baboy as
an imaginary setting and in the popularity of Pugad Baboy as
contemporar y popular text in the Philippines, is decidedly middle-class
in its assumptions and in its trappings, in contrast with either more rustic
or lower-class affinities that earlier Philippine comics that dealt with the
familial/communal depicted (Buhay Pilipino or even Tisoy, for example),
or more amorphous settings not clearly indicative of class definitions, or
which elide such characterizations invested by economic or class
distinctions but hint at it (Kalabog en Bosyo or Barok, for instance).  We
laugh at the antics and adventures of the Pugad Baboy characters because
of the fleeting acknowledgment of the occasions and implications of the
strips: politics, religion, workaday vexations, relationships, daily ironies,
class struggles, gender issues, racist stereotypes—not as these are born
out of generalized concerns but as these are rooted in, and emerge out of,
middle-class sensibilities. We recognize the twists in the Pugad Baboy
characters as seen by way of a Filipino valuation of  fatness, for example.
Medina’s take on corpulence is to subvert its apparent inferiority to make
for a centering and, indeed, a celebration of this in the text, by allotting
for these characters a definite place in which belonging, nominally and
communally, becomes central to the text. And even when, as in “Hiwaga
ng Duenas,” the Pugad Baboy characters are literally transplanted on to
another locale, they end up triumphant over the conflicts in this new
setting by bringing with them their urban or urbanized sensibilities.
This attempt at centering, though, does not come as
straightfor wardly as it should. Because these characters are made to
navigate the vagaries of Filipino society, the humor engendered by
the text comes, too, at the expense of more politically correct sensibilities.
The humor of the strip, however, is mined by way of juxtapositions of
expectations of the reader’s familiarity with Filipino customs still
applicable even among urban folk, national or local concerns, whether
political or economic, pastimes which make for cultural practices in the
Philippines—basketball, drinking, fortune-telling—and a knowledge
not only of the language but the connotative inflections inherent in it to
signal contrary and contradictory meanings, and a more fragmentar y
knowledge of a collage of technology- or media-engineered realities that

“Pig’s Nest” in an Even Bigger Pen
83  
form the backdrop of these. The familiarity with such cultural background
and the knowledge of its more hyperreal roots and implications is based
on assumptions, I think, of the dominance and the range of such a
discourse in the Philippines. However, the use of humor to affirm this
middle-class/popular discourse, on the one hand, and the comic depiction
to subvert the ver y real pathos of the impact of such postmodern
disjunctures, on the other, serves to reframe the Pugad Baboy folk as
representations of the contemporar y Filipino and to defamiliarize Filipino
spiritual and cultural beliefs, political disempowerment, and economic
dislocations.  If we look at these too closely, however, the laughter is lost.
We find ourselves asking more and more what this comedy is, for
in the Philippine context “to problematize . . . folk and postmodernist
metaphors is to chart the finely graded distinctions and hierarchies that
map popular culture . . . to negotiate difference and belonging” (McLuskie
492).  Pugad Baboy has found a way to show and to veil these differences:   
It is a hilarious and maddening commentary on the state of
our society: the trapos, magnanakaws, manlolokos, mayabangs,
sinungalings, switiks, walang-hiyas, gagos, tangas, tarantados,
bastos, siga-sigas, walang pinag-aralans, and the kapal-mukhas
who constitute its hard crust, and the long-suffering simple
folk who constitute its soft core. (Henares 3)
And the Pugad Baboy characters end up as the tricksters—and
the tricked. They are, in Henares’ terms, both the simple folk and the
evil elements that prey on them. But these characters do not stand
still. Despite their bulk, or because of it, they embody “the people
negotiating their readings, reworking and interpreting culture”
(Webster 227). Pugad Baboy becomes a ver y potent locus for the
presentation, the study, the reapplications of the dynamics within a
cultural hegemony, and the peripheral problems that confront,
challenge, or elide this.  Medina’s Pugad Baboy characters, whom we
find on the one hand to be embodiments of the same negotiations
that we go through in a real cultural/traditional milieu, are also
characters who redefine the responses to this culture by way of the
intentionality, the contextual specificities of the humor in the strip.
Though we, the readers, who laugh at this daily renegotiation
and  “play with culture and non-culture” (Spinks 191), are ourselves
part of this “play of identification between the knowing subject of cultural

Ancheta
84  
studies, and a collective subject: ‘the people’” (Webster 227), we
nevertheless realize that humor, while used as a device that
recontextualizes culture or at least follows its gaps or its appropriations,
may itself be construed as a “distancing” mode. Whether in terms of
cultural practices, language, daily realities, or personality, the Filipino in
Pugad Baboy is recognizable, but Pugad Baboy also re-presents Philippine
culture in a way that we can never really enter, as its depiction of these
realities and cultural constructions (or reconstructions) are threaded
through, modified, or fragmented by humor as an operative constant,
which we may be privy to and which we may ourselves employ, but not
at all times.  Our own engagement with Philippine culture becomes,
then, an utile vantage point from which we can critique Pugad Baboy as
text, but it is its presentation of humor, and humor segueing from the
complexities of these experiences within proscribed Filipino culture, that
becomes the medium for this “play with/within culture,” tracking the
advent not only of fragmentation or disjuncture within Philippine social
or cultural realms, so palpably depicted in this strip, but of multiplicities
piled into hyperrealities  that is at the center of this text.
We have moved our analysis of Pugad Baboy, the comic strip, from
being an artifact of popular culture to the sign of the collective trickster:
“the cultural vortex which allows the ver y process of transformation . . .
see[n] as the basic driver of cultural change.”  The trickster does this by
“embody[ing] the processing of cultural material from a state of non-
culture to a state of cultural use . . . a semiotic generator of forms, language,
cultural concepts and context” (Spinks 177-8). What we see as the comic
postmodernity of and in Pugad Baboy, whether socially corrective or
culturally liminal, is a  manifestation of this simultaneous generation of
multiple signs of culture. Will this  provide an answer to how it is Filipino
or what is Filipino in it?
Perhaps it has already begun to do so.

Abstract    
Rizal’s four years in Dapitan have not been fully explored for the light
they can shed on contemporary issues in community development and
education. In particular, the significance of  the school he founded in Talisay
has not merited scholarly commentary. Those fruitful four years in Dapitan
have become Rizal’s most unappreciated legacy, yet they are precisely what
make Rizal singularly relevant to the 21    
st century. This essay explains why.

Prologue ProloguePrologue Prologue
Prologue
Dapitan in Zamboanga del Norte has always celebrated its town fiesta
with fireworks, from the Spanish colonial era to today’s Republic.  Fireworks,
as the Chinese had taught us, are meant to drive away the demons and bring
cheer for happier and more prosperous days.  Dapitan’s fiesta on July 24,1892
seemed like any other fiesta when firecrackers blew up in the hands of a careless
man.  But as he writhed helplessly in pain—the bystanders could do nothing
but look on in pity—an unknown doctor hurried down from Casa Real to
attend to him.  This was the distinguished doctor who had just arrived days
before and that propitious night was his introduction to the people of Dapitan
and the neighboring towns.  The doctor’s name was Jose Rizal.   
1   
Within a year, the newcomer would be more esteemed and revered than
Dapitan’s pompous overlords. Wenceslao Retana, in his now classic 1907 Vida
y Escritos del Dr. Jose Rizal, the first full-length documented biography of  Rizal,
recounts:
The townsfolk adored and revered him. “Dr Rizal!” people would
call out, with great respect, upon seeing him pass by: they doffed

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
2   
their hats and bowed. The townsfolk greeted him with more
reverence than they did the comandante and the parish priest.  Just
as he enjoyed fame as a wise man amongst Europeans for being
an indio puro, the natives thought of  him as something extraterrestrial
(p.18). 
2   
Four years later, on July 31, 1896, as the sun was setting, Rizal walked
from his house to Talisay’s shores for the last time.  Frank Laubach describes
the scene:
All the people of Dapitan, old and young, formed a funeral
procession and walked weeping to the shore, saying as they went:
“We will never see our Doctor Rizal again.” Seven   
3 of  his loyal
students went with him to Manila.  The other boys wept because
they were too poor to go (1909, ch.14). 
Who was this man, this “extraterrestrial” being? What did he do in
Dapitan? How did he live among the townsfolk? Why did they weep upon
seeing him leave for good?
On the deck of  the ship that was to take him away, as he looked at the
teary-eyed townsfolk, still waving bandanas and tree branches, he must have
smiled and waved back with mixed feelings of gratitude, a sense of fulfilment
and sadness.  A sense of  fulfilment, because, in Dapitan, he had put into practice
all that he had advocated in his writings. Gratitude, because he could not have
done much without the townsfolk’s enthusiastic support and participation.  And
sadness, because he was leaving a cherished place of refuge that he knew in his
heart he would never see again. As he affectionately described it:
Dapitan is situated by a handsome bay that faces West, on some
sort of  island formed expressly for her, as if  in order to isolate
her from the vulgar world, by a lovely river which to this end has
graciously consented to split itself  into two, thus to embrace her
with two silvery arms and carry her towards the sea as an offering,
the most beautiful that it has found in its tortuous and eventful
pilgrimage over mountains and valleys, through forests and plain
(Translated from the original Spanish by George Aseniero; cited
in Walpole, 2011).
Having settled in his cabin, Rizal recounted in his diary the hectic
preparations for his departure. Of his life in Dapitan, however, he could only
write, “I have been in that district four years, thirteen days, and a few hours.”
Tired and gripped with sadness and foreboding, Rizal could say no more. But
what momentous years they were!

Forging the nation in Dapitan
The Spanish colonial state had presumed that in exiling Rizal to Dapitan
they were punishing and isolating a recalcitrant subversive. Because he was a
European-educated polymath, and, at 31 years of age, already an accomplished
man of science and letters and adored by his compatriots, he was considered a
dangerous and formidable enemy of  the state and the church. But the wily
Jesuits, who were entrusted with the spiritual care of  Mindanao, took on the
challenge to win him back to the fold.  Rizal’s former mentors had hoped that,
through their influence, he would revert to being the devoted Atenean of his
teenage years.
But rather than returning to the fold like the prodigal son, Rizal ended
up transforming his adopted town towards his radical vision of  human
development and social justice and thus resolving the urgent question of how
Filipinos should live and relate to each other, and what sort of nation we
should aspire to be.
Rizal had agonized over this question in the Noli-Fili, and the answer he
came up with was:  cast away greed and selfishness, “unite with the people,”
“sow an idea,” and “aspire to be a nation.” All very well, but these were
motherhood statements that did not address the pressing question: What is to
be done?  When the disconsolate Simoun pressed Fr. Florentino for an answer,
all that the good priest could say was a disappointing, “Suffer and wait.”  It
seemed that Rizal had not yet figured out the answer in the Fili.
Two years after writing El Filibusterismo, Rizal was closer to the answer.
The way forward was to form the La Liga Filipina, a mass-based organization
that would pursue a five-point program of  social transformation, namely: 1)
unite the whole archipelago into one compact, vigorous, and homogenous
body; 2) mutual protection in every case of trouble and need, 3) defense against
every violence and injustice; 4) development of education, agriculture, and
commerce; 5) study and implementation of  reforms.
Post-colonial Filipinos (unlike the un-Americanized Katipunan and
revolutionary ilustrados) have misconstrued the fifth aim of the Liga— “Estudio
y aplicaciòn de reformas”—to mean the study and application of  reformist measures
within the framework of the colonial system. This is contrary to what was
meant by Rizal, who regarded such measures as merely “palliative”:  
We said, and once more we repeat, and will ever assert, that
reforms which have a palliative character are not only ineffectual

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
4   
but even prejudicial, when the government is confronted with evils
that must be cured radically (1912a, emphasis in original).
The term reformas in the context of  the Liga referred to the radical changes
that will redound to the benefit of the people and lead to the development of
the country independent of Spain.
The Spanish regime correctly saw Rizal’s project as a movement towards
an independent nation and, thus, promptly arrested and exiled him to Dapitan
in 1892.  This event proved to be a blessing in disguise for it was in Dapitan
that Rizal finally realized and put into practice the solution to the problem
posed by Simoun in the Fili.
Rizal had declared explicitly in 1888 that “our sacred mission” is “the
formation of  the Filipino nation.”  Rizal’s July 27, 1888 letter to Mariano Ponce
reads in part:
If  you write to Plaridel [del Pilar’s nom de plume], please tell him
that I rejoice with our country and all our good countrymen that
we are united and solid so that we can help one another... On the
day when all Filipinos should think like him and like us, on that
day we shall have fulfilled our sacred mission which is the formation of
the Filipino nation (italics mine; in Rizal, 1963, p.187).
He had hoped that the Liga would be the means—the social
movement—towards this end.  But where to begin, and how?  In Dapitan,
Rizal realized that the best way, if  not the only way, to proceed is by acting
locally—working with the people of a particular place, using local resources
and responding to local needs.

Rizal’s four years in Dapitan have not been fully explored for the light
they can shed on contemporary issues in community development and education.
So far, I’ve not come across or heard of a coffee table book, let alone a
dissertation on Rizal’s Dapitan years.  His poems during this period have not
been critically studied. More seriously, the significance of  the school he founded
in Talisay has not merited scholarly commentary. This is puzzling, for the
pedagogical innovations he practiced in Talisay anticipate the anti-bureaucratic
and democratic principles of what is now known as “progressive education”
or the “alternative school movement” which historians have divided into the
Progressive Movement (1890-1940) and the Free School Movement (1960-
1975) (see Emery, 2000; Gorham, 2005).

Indeed, Rizal’s Talisay school predates the experimental school projects
of  Rabindranath Tagore’s Santiniketan ashram [ca. 1901], Marietta Johnson’s School
of  Or ganic Education in Fairhope, Alabama (1907), Arthur Morgan’s Moraine Park
School in Dayton, Ohio (1917), A.S.Neill’s Summerhill in Suffolk, England [ca.
1921], Bertrand and Dora Russell’s Beacon Hill School in Sussex, England [ca.
1927].  What these schools have in common is the idea that education should not
be confined within the walls of a classroom, that children learn best by doing
and should be encouraged in their innate desire to discover and explore their
surroundings, that the teacher is most effective when he is a co-learner with his
wards and serves as their role model in the joys and excitement of  learning (see
Kohn, 2008). As Pedagogy of  the Oppressed author Paolo Freire puts it,
Education must begin with the solution of the student-teacher
contradiction by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that
both are simultaneously students and teachers. (Freire, 1982, p.59).
But more than this, the progressive school movement deconstructed the
taken-for-granted idea that the school is an enclave where the student learns
first and then later, after graduation, gets a job and, hopefully, becomes a
productive member of  the community.  Against this notion, it advocated and
practiced the principle that the school is an integral part of community life—
that education is most fruitful when students are learning and working and
promoting the well-being of the community all at the same time.  Ivan Illich, a
leading light in the free school movement, has advocated the creation of
“educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform
each moment of  his living into one of  learning, sharing and caring”.  
5  Rizal’s
school in Talisay may be viewed as one such “educational web.”
The philosophy of progressive education flows from the wellspring of
the Enlightenment—in particular from Rousseau’s Emile, which Rizal had avidly
read.  Emile, nominally a novel but actually Rousseau’s treatise on education, is
addressed to mothers—advising them on how best to nurture their children to
grow to their fullest potential and learn to become self-realizing individuals.
Emile remains as fresh today as when it was published in 1762. Consider this
gem of an advice to prospective mentors:    
Put questions within [the child’s] reach and let him solve them
himself. Let him know nothing because you have told him, but
because he has learned it for himself. (Rousseau, 1762, paragraph
564)

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
6   
Most of the fundamental prescriptions—from Rousseau to Ivan Illich—
are exactly what Rizal’s students lived by in his Talisay school.  It was a
revolutionary educational program way ahead of its time in Catholic Church-
dominated Philippines, if not the whole colonized world of the nineteenth
century.
Those fruitful four years in Dapitan have become Rizal’s most
unappreciated legacy, yet they are precisely what make Rizal singularly relevant
to the 21
st century.

Upon his arrival in Dapitan, Rizal lived in the house of the governor and
military commandant, Capt. Ricardo Carnicero, which was just across the town’s
central plaza.  He later bought, with Carnicero and another Spaniard residing in
Dipolog, a lottery ticket.  This was to prove fortuitous.  Rizal’s lottery ticket
won second prize—20,000 pesos—which was awarded on September 21,
1892, and promptly divided among themselves by the three men.  From his
share of 6,200 pesos, Rizal gave 2,000 pesos to his father and 200 pesos to pay
his debt to his friend Basa in Hong Kong (Baron-Fernandez, 1981, p. 255).   
7   
With what remained of his lottery earnings, Rizal was able to move to
Talisay, a coastal barrio off  the Dapitan poblacion named after the talisay, a
large deciduous tree that is usually found along Philippine seashores. Rizal bought
a 16-hectare piece of  land.  But, as he noted in his February 8, 1893 letter to his
brother-in-law Manuel Hidalgo, there were no talisay trees in Talisay, so Rizal
thought of naming his place Balunò or Baunò, after the large trees that actually
grew there.  The first thing he did was to clear the land “to sow rice and corn”
(Rizal, 1964, p. 356). Then he built a house, a clinic and a school for local boys
who he described as mostly “poor and intelligent.” On March 7, 1893, he
wrote to Hidalgo saying:
My house will be finished either tomorrow or after tomorrow. It is
very pretty for its price (40 pesos) and it turned out better than
what I wanted.  My lot cannot be better and I am improving it
every day... I’m sure that if  you come, you will be pleased with my
property.  I have plenty of  land to accommodate at least five
families with houses and orchards. (Rizal, 1964, pp. 358-359)
In his sojourns, Rizal had always dreamed of  settling down in a farm
and founding a school.  In his March 31, 1890 letter to his best friend, the
Austrian ethnologist Ferdinand Blumentritt, he confided his wish to build a
secular and independent school in the Philippines, with Blumentritt as the director,

F.  Q   UIBUYEN 
7   
and to devote himself entirely to the pursuit of science and the study and
writing of  history (Rizal, 1961a, Vol. II, p.344). Now the dream of  a school
was coming true—with him as the teacher!
Describing his charmed life in Talisay, Rizal wrote to Blumentritt on
Dec. 19, 1893:  
I shall tell you how we live here. I have three  houses; one square,
another hexagonal, and a third octagonal, all of  bamboo, wood and
nipa.  In the  square house we live, my mother, sister Trinidad, a
nephew and I; in the octagonal live my boys or some good
youngsters whom I teach arithmetic, Spanish and English 
8; and in
the  hexagonal  live  my  chickens.  From  my house  I hear  the
murmur  of  a crystal clear  brook which comes from the high rocks;
I see the seashore, the sea where I have small boats, two canoes
or barotos, as they say here. I have many fruit trees, mangoes,
lanzones, guayabanos, baluno, nangka, etc.  I have rabbits, dogs, cats,
etc. I rise early—at five—visit my plants, feed the chickens, awaken
my people and put them in movement. At half-past seven we
breakfast with tea, pastries, cheese, sweetmeats, etc. Later I treat  my
poor patients who come to my land; I dress, I go to the town in
my baroto, treat the people there, and return at 12
when my luncheon awaits me.  Then I teach the boys until 4 P.M.
and devote the after-noon to agriculture. I spend the night reading
and studying. (Rizal, 1961a, Vol. II, p.475)    
Retana’s account of  Rizal’s role as a teacher is effusively appreciative:
How could he not be adored, when he was second father to all
abandoned children who turned up?  What’s more, he taught them
the art of catching insects, gathering shells, etc., brought them
home, fed them, clothed and tidied them up, and practiced
passionate charity to the extreme in teaching them Spanish, English,
French and German. Those who excelled, who could give the
name of a thing in more languages than the others, were awarded
with something extraordinary, a knickknack, a novelty, and this
encouraged others to emulate them, so that rare was the urchin
who did not strive to learn and be a useful boy. He became a
teacher, as can be seen in letters he wrote in the years 95 and 96
to his family.  He made the boys useful by constructing a dam of
stonework which served to conduct water from a waterfall into
the house which he had built in a place called Talisay, near the
center of  Dapitan. (Translated from Retana, 1907, p. 318)

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
8   
Retana’s account may be faulted for its strange reference to “abandoned
children” (practically all were entrusted to Rizal by their parents) and its glaring
omission of  the role of  Rizal’s partner Josephine Bracken, who was in fact the
one who looked after the children and kept them glued to their homework
when Rizal was away.  Rizal said so himself  in his March 12, 1896 letter to his
mother: “She bathes them, and washes and mends their clothes, so that, poor
girl, she is never at rest, but she does it willingly for she has a great love for the
boys, and they love her more than they love me!”    
9   
Interesting details about life in Rizal’s Talisay school are now coming to
light, thanks to the reminiscences and anecdotes of  Rizal’s former pupils and
their descendants.  Rizal’s nephew, Estanislao Herbosa (the great grandfather of
the Philippines’ current Undersecretary of  Health, Dr. Teodoro Herbosa) who
was an eight-year-old participant in Rizal’s school, interviewed in his 80s by
Rizal’s grandnephew Saturnina Rizal-Hidalgo’s grandson Angel Hidalgo, recalled
that in the mornings, Dr. Rizal would usually go to town to visit his patients.
Josephine Bracken was left in charge of his students and she would see to it
that they finished their homework. (Hidalgo, 1971, pp. 31-38)
George Aseniero, grandson of  Rizal’s star pupil, Jose Aseniero (who
became governor of the province of Zamboanga in 1925-1928), relates that
Estanislao’s son, the late Francisco (Paquito) Herbosa, told him when he visited
us in Dapitan that his little puppy of a father was “in love” with Josephine
(George Aseniero, personal communication, 06 October 2011).  From his Lolo’s
memoirs, Aseniero also learned that Rizal’s Talisay school was both a primary
and secondary school (modelled after the German gymnasium), and that Rizal
was both a teacher and surrogate father to his nephews:
…in effect there were two groups of students: the high school
boys (those who were 16 by 1896, including my lolo) and the
elementary kids who were primarily Rizal’s nephews who were
sent over to him for guardianship given the turmoil in the Rizal
family in Luzon. The Herbosa kids had lost their father to cholera,
so Tio Pepe would be the surrogate father. Maria had divorced,
so little Moris needed a surrogate father too. And of  course the
surrogate mother was Josephine, who was adored by the nephews.
The older boys’ curriculum was based on the German high school,
Rizal’s ideal.  And they were meant to be cadres who would go on
to pursue higher education.  They would then form the core group
of teachers for a future institution of higher learning that Rizal
was planning for with Blumentritt.  The four boys he took with

F.  Q   UIBUYEN 
9   
him to Manila were going to study medicine, law, agriculture and
(my lolo) engineering.  10  
As if  following the advice of  the narrator-mentor in Rousseau’s Emile,
Rizal was keenly aware and accepting of the individual differences among his
nephews and adjusted his educational approach to each one. He wrote his
sister Lucia (February 12, 1896):
[Teodosio] has more liking for the land than for the books. We
cannot all be doctors.  It is necessary that there be some to cultivate
the land.  One must follow one’s inclination.  Tan [Estanislao], on
the other hand, is a boy who likes to study and has ability... When
I asked them what was their order in Manila, Teodosio asked for
his bolo and Tan for his book.” (Rizal, 1964, p.422)
And to his sister Maria, Rizal wrote (March 12, 1896):  11  
[Moris] is just beginning to learn how to write...and he knows how
to swim a little. Only he is too lively and playful, always running
and overturning the bottles in our house... He is bright and beats
the two of  Osio and Tan in memorization, but Tan beats him in
arithmetic and English. In slow reckoning Osio beats them all.
(1964, p.424)
Rizal oversaw his nephews’ physical and mental development and was
proud of  their progress. In an undated letter to Lucia, he wrote:
Your two sons are getting along well in their studies. Now they
send you their letters written by themselves alone without dictation.
They are studying fractions.  They swim a great deal and Osio can
swim until 30 braces, though slowly.  Tanis dives very well and he
is nimble like a fish, but he tires quickly. Tanis is going to be a
strong lad, he now lifts up twenty-five pounds over his head; I
believe he is stronger than Uncle Nengoy. I’m sorry I have no
horse or bicycle to teach them how to ride. They already speak
English. (1964, p.426)
Rizal’s affection for his nephews is revealed in his parting advice to them
when he left for Cuba in 1896:
To Osio [Teodosio]: Continue to be a good boy, studious,
hardworking and obedient.
To Tanis [Estanislao]: Do not try to have the best thing for yourself.
Try to do the best for others.

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
10  
To Moris [Mauricio]: Be always good and obedient.
(Palma, 1949, p.356)
Rizal’s attention was of  course not limited to his nephews. Asuncion
Lopez Bantug, Rizal’s grandniece, portrays Rizal’s resourcefulness, casual teaching
style, and method of assessing and rewarding the progress of his students:
He devised his own teaching aids; made his own writing tools,
blackboards and maps; used natural specimens during lessons;
translated what textbooks were needed but as much as possible
concentrated on practical instruction rather than book learning.
Classes were held at the square house or in the kiosko he had built
as a private retreat for himself on a hillside. Usually he taught
from a hammock, with the boys gathered around him, sitting on
floor or grass or bench, just as they pleased, though whoever was
currently the top scholar occupied a place of  honor. Periodic exams
were given, with outsiders as examiners. Boys with high marks
were rewarded with useful prizes: a pen, a book, a net or a rifle.
(Bantug, 2008, p.134)
Education was not confined within the classroom: the older boys were
taught the use of the rifle and went hunting with Rizal; the younger ones explored
the forest and seashores with Rizal to collect butterflies and assorted bugs, dig
for seashells, and dive for rare fish—which gave them “fascinating if practical
lessons in botany and zoolog y.” (Bantug, 2008, p.134)
And there were gym classes for physical fitness and martial arts—
weightlifting, wrestling, boxing and fencing. Rizal’s grandniece relates a family
anecdote:
During one fencing lesson, his pupils dared him to take all of
them on at the same time. When the mock fray ended, his coat
was still immaculate, unmarked by the sooty ends of the bamboo
swords they wielded. No one won the prize he had offered to
whoever could smudge his clothes. (Bantug, 2008, p.135)
What an exciting departure from the insipid and staid parochial school!
But there was more—Rizal also taught his pupils lessons in courage and the art
of  living well and wisely.  Again from Rizal’s grandniece,
To instil courage in them, he would on dark nights start a session,
all about ghosts and vampires and monsters, until they were all a-
shudder. Then he would send them one by one out into the dark

F.  Q   UIBUYEN 
11  
night, to fetch a cane he had hung on a tree, or a bundle he had
left on the hillside, or some package planted on the riverside.
(Bantug, 2008, p.135)
Bantug forgot to mention a riveting method that Rizal devised to entice
his young wards to think about the future and the larger questions of life—a
fortune-telling board game he named La Sibila Cumana, after a prophetess in
Greek legend. (The rule for playing was simple:  the player chooses one question
on a list and then spins a top on a board marked with numbers and Roman
numerals that point to a corresponding answer or explanation in a card. Rizal
arranged the numbers such that many different types of answers could come
out, depending on where the top spun to a stop.)    
12  
Rizal also had an ingenious way of dealing with infractions among his
students. One day in 1894, some of  his students secretly rowed a boat from
Talisay to the town. A puppy of  Rizal’s dog followed them but was devoured
by a crocodile. The students felt guilty and upset by the puppy’s horrible end.
Rizal, however, did not simply reprimand them for disobeying his rule not to
go to town without his permission. He made a moral lesson out of  it in a
creative way—by sculpting a statue of the mother dog killing the crocodile and
entitling it “The Mother’s Revenge”, thus driving the point that the mother was
grief-stricken when she lost her puppy (Craig, 1913, pp.203-204).
What a wonderful time Rizal’s students must have had in all those four
years! The schoolmaster’s words in the Noli Me Tangere, ca. 1887, could veritably
be Rizal’s, ca. 1896, except that in Dapitan, no friar frustrated his pedagogical
project:
I endeavoured to make study a thing of  love and joy, I wished to
make the primer not a black book bathed in the tears of childhood
but a friend who was going to reveal wonderful secrets, and of
the schoolroom not a place of sorrows but a scene of intellectual
refreshment. So, little by little, I abolished corporal punishment,
taking the instruments of it entirely away from the school and
replacing them with emulation and personal pride. If one was
careless about his lesson, I charged it to lack of desire and never
to lack of  capacity. I made them think that they were more capable
than they really were, which urged them on to study just as any
confidence leads to notable achievements. At first it seemed that
the change of method was impracticable; many ceased their studies,
but I persisted and observed that little by little their minds were
being elevated and that more children came, that they came with
more regularity, and that he who was praised in the presence of

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY

the others studied with double diligence on the next day. (“The
Schoolmaster’s Difficulties,” in chapter 6 of  Noli Me Tangere/Rizal,
1912b). 
Himno a Talisay Himno a TalisayHimno a Talisay Himno a Talisay
Himno a Talisay
In keeping with his participatory pedagog y, and perhaps to celebrate his
most important achievement in Talisay, Rizal wrote Himno a Talisay in 1895,
dedicated to his pupils and meant to be sung by them.
Though hardly taught, much less sang by, school kids today, Himno a
Talisay is not just a beautiful poem, it has historic significance.  The Spanish
authorities used the Himno a Talisay as evidence against Rizal in his trial for
treason in December 1896.  Although Nick Joaquin finds this “incredible”
(1976, p.279), it is easy to see why:  the very thrust of  the new school of  Talisay
was subversive of  the colonial educational system. The Himno a Talisay heralds
something entirely new—a radical departure from the way children were
supposed to be educated and raised at that time.
Consider the Talisay boys’ proud description of  their education in the
new school of  Talisay:
Unlike the rote memorization and passive learning characteristic of the
parochial school, the Talisay system deploys the inquiry method—the stress is
on solving “los problemas de ciencias exactas”, covering both sciences and maths.
The history of  the country, and the study of  three or four languages—which
have been deliberately avoided in the parochial school—are among the hallmark
of  the new Talisay curriculum.  Religion is taught ‘in accordance with reason’,
echoing Rizal’s Dapitan debate (by way of  correspondence) with Fr. Pablo
Pastells on the issue of revelation.    
13  
Remarkably, aside from the academic disciplines, the new school also
teaches practical skills useful in agriculture and construction work—“a azada, la
picqueta”. Moreover, the new school of  Talisay teaches martial arts—“el cuchillo,
el fusil y la espada”—necessary skills of the strong man!   
Los problemas de ciencias exactas,The problems of the exact sciences,

  (my translation)
 The new school keeps the children healthy in body and spirit, nurtures
them to be brave and self-reliant, and to grow into strong and capable men
who can protect their homes, ready to fight effectively when the need arises—
The reference to Lucifer is significant. The boys of  Talisay, the Talisaynons,
as they proudly call themselves, are capable of defending themselves and
subduing Satan—without divine inter vention!
But this heretical point was ignored by the Spanish prosecutors in Rizal’s
trial.  They instead pounced on the lines “en el trance sabremos luchar” and “Nuestros
brazos manejan a un tiempo el cuchillo, la pluma, la azada, la picqueta, el fusil y la espada,
compañeros del fuerte varon” to prove that Rizal was training his boys for revolutionary
action. Rizal, in his defence, nonchalantly replied that he was simply portraying
his young pupils as ready to defend Dapitan in the event of a Moro raid
(Joaquin, 1976, p.279).
Rizal was not being completely honest with the prosecution. For he had
expressed similar sentiments elsewhere.  In his June 27, 1888 letter to Mariano
Ponce, he wrote:    
The principal thing that should be demanded from a Filipino of
our generation is...to be a good man, a good citizen, who would

help his country to progress with his head, his heart, and if need
be, with his arms.  With the head and the heart we ought to work
always; with the arms when the time comes. (Rizal, 1963, p.173)
The whole point of  the new school of  Talisay was precisely to produce
the good human being, the good citizen who would ser ve the country by
promoting the common good. This is the practical realization of the aims of
the La Liga Filipina—which, if  carried out throughout the archipelago, would
lead, as Rizal had dreamed, to the formation of  an independent, prosperous,
just and progressive Filipino nation.

When Rizal arrived in Dapitan in 1892, there were only two colonial
authorities in that district: the Spanish commandant and the Jesuit priest. Judging
from Rizal’s January 15, 1896 letter to his mother, Dapitan had the advantage
of  being free from the dreaded guardia civil and the lecherous friar.  But there
was no park, no streetlights, no irrigation system.  The farming and fishing folk
were left to their ancient devices, without assistance from the colonial regime,
although they were required to pay taxes, go to confession, attend Sunday
mass, and give their weekly offerings to the church.  Although there was a
health officer, there was no medical doctor attending to the medical needs of
the poor villagers, nor, for that matter, was there a hospital.
Dapitan’s dire situation prompted Rizal to pledge: “I want to do all I
can for this town.” 
14  And he did!
Every school kid today must have heard that Rizal developed Dapitan’s
first park, complete with street lamps and a garden/flower relief map of the
whole island of  Mindanao. Not so well discussed are the other, even more
impressive projects.
Rizal built a one-doctor hospital, and paid with his own money for the
medical supplies and instruments.  Notwithstanding his expenses, the Dapitan
folk received free medical and surgical care.  Wenceslao Retana narrates in his
biography of Rizal: 
It was said that Rizal the doctor did not charge anyone who was
of the town. But if a stranger came to consult him, and there
were several, he charged them according to their means; money
thus earned he dedicated entirely to something or other that would
redound to the benefit of the town. There was a rich Englishman
who came to consult him: Rizal removed his cataract and charged

F.  Q   UIBUYEN 
15  
him 500 duros, which the Englishman gladly paid. Those 500 duros
Rizal donated to Dapitan for public lighting which it did not have.
In the front yard of his home he built a hospital, open to all on his
account… (Translated from Retana, 1907, p. 318)
Retana does not quite capture the difficulties that Rizal had to surmount.
Rizal wrote Jose Basa on December 18, 1894:
This town of  Dapitan is very good. I’m in good ter ms with
everyone. I live peacefully, but the town is very poor, very poor.
Life in it is not unpleasant to me because it is isolated and lonesome;
but I am sorry to see so many twisted things and not be able to
remedy them, for there is no money or means to buy instruments
and medicine. Here a man fell from a coconut tree and perhaps I
could have saved him if  I had instruments and chloroform on
hand. I perfor m operations with the little that I have. I treat
lameless and hernias with reeds and canes. I do the funniest cures
with the means available. I cannot order anything, for the patients
cannot pay; at times I even give medicine gratis. (Rizal, 1963, p.
717)
In addition to being Dapitan’s unofficial or non-governmental public
health provider, Rizal engaged in what we now call “social entrepreneurship”,
perhaps the first Filipino, if  not the first Asian, to do so.  Social entrepreneurship
is innovative business activity aimed principally at benefiting and transforming
the community in which it is undertaken (with most of the profit reinvested
back into the community). Martin and Osberg’s description of  the modern
social entrepreneur, in contrast to the typical capitalist, could very well fit Rizal:  
15  
[The social entrepreneur] neither anticipates nor organizes to create
substantial financial profit for his or her investors...or for himself
or herself.  Instead, the social entrepreneur aims for value in the
form of  large-scale, transformational benefit that accrues either
to a significant segment of society or to society at large. ...[The
social entrepreneur’s project] targets an underserved, neglected,
or highly disadvantaged population that lacks the financial means
or political clout to achieve the transformative benefit on its own.
This does not mean that social entrepreneurs as a hard-and-fast
rule shun profitmaking... Ventures created by social entrepreneurs
can certainly generate income, and they can be organized as either
not-for-profits or for-profits.   What distinguishes social
entrepreneurship is the primacy of social benefit, what Duke
University professor Greg Dees in his seminal work on the field
characterizes as the pursuit of ‘mission-related impact’. (Martin &
Osberg, 2007, pp. 34-35)

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
16  
Rizal formed Dapitan’s first farmers’ cooperative, the Sociedad de
Agricultores Dapitanos (SAD), where capital was to be provided by “socios
industriales” [industrial partners] and “socios accionistas” [shareholders]. As stated
in the Estatutos de la Sociedad de Agricultores Dapitanos, 1 Enero 1895, the SAD
aimed to “improve/promote agricultural products, obtain better profits for
them, provide capital for the purchase of these goods, and help to the extent
possible the harvesters and labourers by means of  a store (co-op) where articles
of  basic necessity are sold at moderate prices” (Rizal, 1961b, pp. 328-330).
Rizal also engaged in a joint-venture with a certain Carreon (a Spanish
businessman) for the construction and operation of a lime-burner (for making
building mortar), whereby Rizal would provide capital and Carreon would
mobilize and supervise labor whose wages were to be paid by Rizal; these
advances would be deducted from the sale proceeds of lime, the profit thereof
to be equally divided between Rizal and Carreon.
Nothing that needed improvement, or offered the prospect of boosting
the local economy, escaped Rizal’s eye. When he saw the inefficient fishing
methods of the fisherfolk of Dapitan, he sought to remedy it, using his personal
funds. He wrote his brother-in-law Manuel “Maneng” Hidalgo on January 19,
1893:
Here I have formed a partnership with a Spaniard to supply the
town with fish of  which it lacks. In Dapitan alone there are six
thousand inhabitants and in the interior some two or three
thousands more and for so many people there is nothing but small
sakag that catches little fish of the size of the talaisá.  Aquilino told
me that with one pukútan [net] alone like yours, the whole town
could be supplied with fish, because here there is a good beach
and fish abound a little distance away from the shore.  If you wish
to sell me your pukútan at an agreed price, and if it is still in good
condition, I would buy it. If not, I would appreciate it if you
would buy me a pukútan in the same condition, good, strong, etc.
Here nobody knows how to weave the mesh of a net... I would
appreciate also very much if you would look for me for two men
or families of  the beach of  Kalamba who understand fishing.  If
they come, I will pay their fare.... They will have a house and all
they may need for their subsistence. I believe this would be a good
business. (Rizal, 1964, p. 354)
Another new technology Rizal introduced was the European method
of  brickmaking.  He wrote Blumentritt on November 20,1895: “I have made
a wooden machine for making bricks and I believe that with it I can make at

F.  Q   UIBUYEN 
17  
least 6,000 a day; well now, I lack an oven” (Rizal, 1961a, p. 514). He eventually
built an oven whose remnant can still be seen in Dapitan today. 16  
With the support of  Dapitan’s authorities—the military governor and
the Jesuits—and the townsfolk, who provided the labor, Rizal initiated important
public work projects for the benefit of  the community. He designed Dapitan’s
first water system—a clay pipeline that delivered springwater from the hilltop
to the edge of  the town where people came in bancas to get drinking water.
Years later, under a new colonial regime, an American engineer, H.F. Cameron,
inspected Dapitan’s water system and was impressed:
[The water]   supply   comes   from   a   little mountain   stream   across 
the  river  from  Dapitan  and follows the contour of the  country
for the whole distance. When one considers that Doctor Rizal had
no explosives with which to block the hard rocks and no resources
save his own ingenuity, one cannot help but honor a man, who
against adverse conditions, had the courage and tenacity to
construct the aqueduct which had for its bottom the fluted tiles
from the house roofs, and was covered with concrete made from
lime burned from the sea coral. The length of this aqueduct is
several kilometers, and it winds in and out among the rocks and is
carried across gullies in bamboo pipes upheld by rocks or brick
piers to the distribution reservoir.    
17  
Ironically, Rizal’s success in Dapitan belies what the opening lines of  the
Noli insinuate—that the country “shut its doors against nothing except commerce
and all new or bold ideas.” Unlike Ibarra and the schoolmaster in the Noli, Rizal
was given a free hand and, in some cases, even supported by the authorities in
Dapitan. Captain Carnicero and his successor Sitges provided funding for Rizal’s
public works. These included the water pipeline, kiln for brick-making,
streetlamps, Mindanao map, plaza beautification and clean-up of  marshes to
get rid of  mosquitoes. Rizal built Dapitan’s first waterworks with the help of
Fr. Sanchez and some Jesuit brothers. The support from the authorities plus the
enthusiastic involvement of the townsfolk enabled Rizal to successfully carry
out his projects.  And although he did not receive any official support for his
Talisay school project, it appears that neither the commandant nor the Jesuits
interfered with Rizal’s unconventional pedagogical activities.
But some contrary thoughts intrude: Could Rizal’s exemplary behavior
in Dapitan—ostensibly supported or at least tolerated by the local authorities—
have convinced the powers-that-be in Manila (who were receiving regular
confidential updates on Rizal from Dapitan’s military governor) that Rizal was
a hopeless subversive whose vision and strategies for social change posed a real

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
18
threat to Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines, and, therefore, must be put
away?  Thus, in December 1896, Rizal was tried in Fort Santiago for being “the
principal organizer and living soul of the Filipino insurrection”.  
18 It was a sham;
the guilty verdict was a foregone conclusion.
By the beginning of 1896, apparently oblivious to what would soon
befall him, Rizal had set his mind to settling down in Dapitan for good, in a
place that was apparently lovelier than Talisay, as Rizal’s January 15 letter to his
mother shows:   
I bought here a piece of land beside a river that has great
resemblance to the Calamba river, with the only difference that
this here is wider and its stream is more abundant and crystalline...
My land has 6,000 abaca plants. If  you want to come here, I shall build
a house where we can all live together until we die. I am going to persuade
my father to come and beside me, I hope he will always be gay.
My land is beautiful; it is in the interior, far from the sea, about a
half-hour’s walk; it is in a very picturesque place. The land is very
fertile. In addition to the abaca plantation there is land for planting
two cavanes [150 liters] of corn. Little by little we can buy the
remaining lands near mine. There are plenty of dalag [mudfish],
pakò [ferns] and little round stones... If  you come and they grant
me freedom to establish myself there, we are going to revive our
old town, without friars or civil guards, without bandits. (Rizal,
1964, pp.416-417; italics mine)
Alas, Rizal’s proto-utopian dream would not come true. And today, the
irenic idyll of  Talisay is all forgotten.

Epilogue:  Rizal’s legacy and Dapitan today
In his four years in Dapitan, Rizal played multiple roles:  doctor, social
worker, farmer, social entrepreneur, public works engineer, town planner, school
founder, teacher and scientist.  He worked with the people as a civic volunteer,
for he was unwaged and without an official title. Whatever earnings he made
from his social entrepreneurship and from his wealthy patients went to the
upkeep of his household, school and hospital.  He took to his tasks with vigor
and vitality—mindful that they were all part of his pledge to do everything he
could for Dapitan.  Rizal’s four years there are unparalled in the history of  the
Philippines, if not Southeast Asia.
We can point to a few similar cases of  exemplary community service,
but they come only after Rizal—the German-born French citizen and polymath

F.  Q   UIBUYEN 
19  
Albert Schweitzer, who built a hospital in Lambarènè, Gabon in 1913; the
New Zealand-born Australian ophthalmologist Fred Hollows, who pioneered
the treatment of eye diseases among Aboriginal Australians in the 1970s and
did philantrophic medical missions in Nepal in 1985, Eritrea in 1987 and Vietnam
in 1991; and the Briton Eric Jensen, who lived and worked among the longhouse-
dwelling Iban Dayaks of  Sarawak, Borneo, from 1959-1966, engaging in what
is now hailed as a model of “on-the-ground development” covering areas
such as “education, skills training programmes, health care, agricultural extension,
encouraging attitudinal and behavioural change, promoting infrastructural
improvements, and interaction with government bureaucracy”. 
19  
Unlike his successors, however, Rizal had not received any accolade,
even posthumously—in the Philippines and internationally—for his four years
in Dapitan, where he was not simply a medical doctor like Schweitzer or
Hollows or a community development officer like Jensen. Rizal was both
doctor and community worker, and a pioneer educator to boot!
Progressive education is perhaps Rizal’s greatest legacy in Dapitan.  In his
Talisay school, Rizal pioneered what are now extolled as “school-based
management” and “community-based education”—concepts which Dr. Maria
Luisa C. Doronila is said to have spearheaded and promoted in Philippine
education (Abrera et al., 2009, p.90).
“School-based management” is the decentralization of authority from
the central government to the school level wherein responsibility for, and
decision-making authority over school operations is transferred to principals,
teachers, and parents, and sometimes to students and other school community
members (Caldwell, 2005). However, as the World Bank is keen to stress, “these
school-level actors have to conform to or operate within a set of  policies
determined by the central government” (World Bank 2008, p.2). Rizal’s Talisay
school went further.  Neither confor ming to nor operating within the framework
of  the colonial system, Rizal’s school went outside of  it, thereby subverting it.
Doronila writes of ‘community-based education’ as a “school of the
people”—a “learning community where literacy and education, as well as social
participation, mobilization and advocacy for reform are integrated towards
the singular and continuing project of enabling people to move from the
margins of society to a social space in the mainstream which they have created
and helped to transform for themselves” (1996, p.192).  Doronila acknowledges
Paolo Freire as the source of this concept, but she could as well have cited Rizal
whose pedagogical practice in Talisay in 1892 to 1896 may be regarded as the
beginnings of ‘community-based education’ in Asia.

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
20  
Rather than celebrating Rizal’s trail-blazing accomplishments in Dapitan,
however, the Philippine state has been fixated on the yearly commemoration
of his December martyrdom.  This is the singular event that is celebrated in
pomp and ceremony, speeches and flowers for a day, while the enduring and
ever cogent message of  Rizal’s four years in Dapitan is unfortunately missed or
ignored, year after year.
The model community that Rizal built in Talisay has since been made
into a stale museum of replicas of his house, school and clinic, sitting like
fossilized relics on manicured lawns for the benefit of the uncomprehending
tourist.  This shrine, which is overseen by the National Historical Commission
(formerly the National Historical Institute) but managed by the local government,
comprises 10 hectares of  Rizal’s original 16-hectare property in Talisay.  The
other six hectares were gifted by Rizal to his pupil and valet Jose Acopiado in
1896, when he set off for Manila enroute to Cuba.  The Acopiado heirs now
occupy some three hectares; the rest have been taken over by squatters, among
them a Rizalista cult.  The beach is littered with the plastic detritus of modern
living.
20
Save for the dam which is in a decrepit state, the other infrastructure that
Rizal built with the help of the townsfolk are now forgotten ruins and discarded
debris.  A recent visitor, the environmentalist Jesuit Pedro Walpole, notes with
chagrin what came of the structures that Rizal had designed and built:
It is a wonderful surprise to find the base of the lion fountain in
the tidal waste of  Barangay Talisay. Stretches of  the double clay
piping are still visible along the hillside… The domed oven [where
the clay pipes were baked] now supports a barangay road on top
of  it and has pigs at one end and roosters at the other. (Walpole,
2011)
Judging from his description of  Talisay in his poem Mi Retiro, Rizal would
weep were he to see today, ca 2011, the Talisay that he gave away in 1896.
What has the Philippine Centennial Commission (PCC) done with the
reported 35-million peso fund that was allocated for the Dapitan shrine during
the centenary of the Revolution in 1998?  The Manila experts    
21 cavalierly (without
consulting the Dapitanos) proceeded to build boardwalks all over the Dapitan
shrine, presumably so that tourists can walk around the shrine without soiling
their shoes.    
 They also thought it nice to build, obser ves Walpole, “a new
monument to Rizal on the foreshore where he arrived and was escorted to the
Casa Real in 1892 and a cement prow of  a boat in the coastal wall at Talisay

F.  Q   UIBUYEN 
21  
from where he left in 1896” (2011). This two-fold achievement of the boardwalk
and the cement prow was later touted by one of  the PCC museology experts
as “a most recent effort of the comprehensive curatorial rehabilitation of the
site of exile of the Philippine national hero” and “the Philippines’ first realization
of a completely outdoor museum in an environmentally protected site” (‘Marian
Pastor Roces’, n.d.).
Before long, the fund had vanished into thin air. Nothing was left.  There
were no other efforts to revive Rizal’s forgotten legacy in Talisay and transform
it into a flourishing heritage site for the benefit of present and future generations
of  Filipinos.  
22  
Imagine if  Rizal’s 16 hectares were converted into a living museum and
cultural center—restoring Rizal’s organic farm, the school and the clinic to their
original function of  serving the needs of  the community, as well as boosting
the local economy through eco-historical tourism?  The 1996-1998 centenary
of  the Philippine Revolution was a lost opportunity.  The meaning of  Rizal’s
Dapitan was overlooked by so-called museology and heritage experts (self-
proclaimed experts with corporate ties are not to be trusted, Ivan Illich had
warned us).
Now forgotten, Rizal’s community work in Talisay and throughout
Dapitan antedate the innovative community development strategies that
concerned social scientists, and progressive economic and political analysts are
advocating today to prepare for the looming ‘triple whammy’ of climate change,
resource depletion (such as peak oil), and the global economic crisis.
Meanwhile, not well covered in the mainstream media or the formal
school curriculum, many community-based initiatives have sprung which aim to
build resilient and sustainable communities—for example:  transition towns,
permaculture (a design system based on natural, organic farming), and
community currencies.  The goal of  these “community solutions” is to enable
communities to overcome the shock of the ‘triple whammy’, and pave the way
for a transition to a steady-state, post-growth, post-capitalist economy.   
23  
One example of a community solution in the event of an economic
meltdown or depression is a form of  exchange that does not involve the
national currency (legal tender) through which people can still obtain the goods
and ser vices they need.  “Time Banks” or “timebanking” is a type of  ‘community
currency’ in which the users create a form of  mutual currency based on time.
Community members can earn the currency by doing community-focused
activities and ‘spend’ it receiving ser vices from others in the community. 
24

RIZAL   ’S LEGACY    FOR     THE     21 ST CENTURY  
22
Although considered an innovative concept in the developed capitalist countries,
timebanking is not exactly new in the Philippines or in Bali, Indonesia. Bali’s
tradition of narayan banjar (work for  the common good of the community)
and the Philippine’s tradition of  bayanihan or bataris (or batarisan) are indigenous
forms of  timebanking.  
25  
Many of  Rizal’s community projects must have been carried out through
a system of  cooperative labor that we now call batarisan.  We could likewise
imagine that the many recipients of  Rizal’s services as a medical doctor, a
secondary school teacher, a community worker, and organizer/manager of his
far m cooperative ‘paid’ or reciprocated by lending their labor-time to his
community projects.  Thus, even with minimal financial resources, the projects
were realized by sheer community spirit.
This, then, is Rizal’s legacy for the 21    
st century:  Dapitan, the creation of
a robust community; a demonstration of what it takes, and how easy it is after
all, to pursue the common good. Bernard Lietaer, professor of finance, designer
of  the Euro and advocate of  community currency, defines community thus—   
The origin of the word “community” comes from the Latin munus,
which means the gift, and cum, which means together, among each
other. So community literally means to give among each other.
Therefore I define my community as a group of people who
welcome and honor my gifts, and from whom I can reasonably
expect to receive gifts in return (1997).
Rizal gifted the people of Dapitan with his vision, his talents and skills,
knowledge and experience to realize projects that would redound to their well-
being; the people, in turn, welcomed and honored his gifts and gave him the
gift of  their labor and wholehearted participation in his projects. It was this
reciprocity and sharing that revitalized Dapitan into a thriving community.
Today, as we prepare for the coming storm, we would do well to learn
from Rizal’s Dapitan years. And, like Rizal, we’ll have to be creative about our
“grassroots innovations” and “community action.”  Actually, we will have no
choice.  With the end of cheap oil, soaring commodity prices and financial
instability, we have to emulate or improve on Rizal’s Dapitan.  Like Rizal’s exile,
the threat of global catastrophes could be a blessing in disguise—forcing us to
rediscover what really matters in our lives.
As energ y analyst James Kunstler puts it:

F.  Q   UIBUYEN 
23  
If  there is any positive side to the stark changes coming our way,
it may be in the benefits of close communal relations, of having
to really work intimately (and physically with your neighbours), to
be part of an enterprise that really matters, and to be fully engaged
in meaningful social enactments instead of being merely entertained
to avoid boredom. (2005, p.304)
Forget Rizal’s martyrdom.  It is how Rizal lived, not how he died, that
will help us now.  Instead of  a national commemoration every December 30,
we Filipinos should be remembering and celebrating July 17, 1892, the day
Rizal arrived in Dapitan.
Rizal’s Dapitan is a story that needs to be told; a story that our present
generation needs to hear if we are to find our way out of the converging
catastrophes of  the 21 
st century, towards a better world.
Notes   
1The firecracker incident is recounted in the unpublished memoirs written in Spanish
of  Jose Aseniero, Rizal’s star pupil in Dapitan, who eventually became governor of  the
province of  Zamboanga (1925-1928) under American rule. Jose Aseniero’s grandson,
George Aseniero, is currently editing and translating the memoirs of  his grandfather for
future publication. Subsequent citations of personal communication from George Aseniero
are mostly based on his grandfather’s memoirs.
2In the original text “los indígenas le conceptuaban algo extraterreno”. Translated by
George Aseniero.
3Laubach’s count was not accurate. In his diary, Rizal wrote,
“Those who were departing were Josephine, my sister N. (Narcisa) and her daughter
Ang. [Angélica], Mr. and Mrs. Súnico, my three nephews, six boys and I” (Rizal,
1896).

Filipino Miss International and Secretary of  the Department of  Tourism under the Estrada
administration.
12The original spinning top, board and cards have been passed on to Francisco
Rizal Lopez, the son of  Emiliana, Paciano’s lovechild.  George Aseniero recalls playing the
board game with Don Francisco in Paciano’s house in Los Baños some years ago (George
Aseniero, personal communication, 21 September 2011). Rizal’s board game was featured
on GMA news TV on May 15, 2011. (See ‘24oras: La Sibila Cumana, nilikhang board

Fourth Letter and Translation of  the Correspondence Together with a Historical Background and
Theological Critique by Jose Rizal, Pablo Pastells, and Raul Bonoan (1994). For non-Jesuit
commentaries, see Hessel (The Religious Thought of  Rizal, 1983); see also Gripaldo, 2002.

his gracious wife Maria were my hosts.  Through them I met the heirs of  Acopiado, who

pupil.

Dapitan folks were not consulted and whether apart from a boardwalk the PCC had not

Abstract        
Contemporarily,  stylistics  today  has  developed  into  its  multiplicity     – one  of  which  is  forensic  stylistics.     
Being a powerfully legal written discourse, Supreme Court decisions are a rich corpus in which linguistic 
vis -a-vis  stylistic  choices  of  Court  justi    ces  could  be  examined.  This  study  is  a  humble  attempt  at  
stylistically  analyzing  Supreme  Court  decisions  in  Philippine  English  (PhE)  drafted  by  two  Filipino 
justices.  Specifically,  it  sought  to  investigate  on  the  classes,  placements,  and  environments  of  ad    verbials    
of  attitude  and  emphasis  employed  by  the  two  justices,  and  drew  their  implications  to  teaching  and 
learning  English  for  Legal  Purposes  (ELP).  Using  McMenamin  (2012),  Quirk,  Greenbaum,  Leech,  and 
Svartvik  (1985),  and  Dita’s  (2011)  frameworks,  54  ra ndomly  selected  Supreme  Court  decisions  as     
primary  sources  of  legal  language  were  analyzed.  Results  are  the  following.  Firstly,  the  classes  of 
adverbials  of  attitude  in  Supreme  Court  decisions  in  PhE  used  by  the  two  judges  were  the     evaluation  to  
the  subjec t  of  the  clause,  judgment  to  the  whole  clause,   and    evaluation  to  an  action  performed  by  the  
subject  of  the  clause,   while  those  adverbials  of  emphasis  were  adverbials     of     conviction   and    doubt   .   
Secondly,  both  adverbials  they  used  have  placements  that  were  fre  quently     medial   and  less  initial  in     
sentences  where  they  belonged.  Thirdly,  the  two  justices  put  their  adverbials  within  two  principal 
environments,  i.e.     within  functor,     and    before/after  the  verb  among  others.  In  these  regard  s,  legal  and  
stylistic explanati ons with respect to these recurrent linguistic features in the two justices’ Court decisions    
were  revealed.  Implications  of  the  study  to  ELP  are  explained.  Lastly,  trajectories  for  future  (forensic) 
stylistic analyses have been recommended.

In  the  21 st century,  stylistics  as  the  study  of  style  in  
language  (McMenamin,  2012)  has  gone  far  beyond 
being  conventional.  Applied  linguists  observe  and 
analyze  the  chronically  idiosyncratic  representation  of 
authors  (or  speakers)  particularly  by  looking  into  the 
style  markers  they  use  in  order  to  determine  the 
linguistic  regularities  portrayed  by  them.  In  turn,  this 
can  be  described  as  peculiar,  and  thus  be  used  to 
detect  the  writing  style  of  an  individual.  Stylistics 
traditionally  lays  its  emphasis  on  the  stringent      
adherence   to language to syntactic accuracy and social    
correctness  in  terms  of  literary    stylistics,  which   has    
placed  itself  to  contemporary  stylistics  such  as 
forensic  stylistics,  an  area  of  innovative  linguistic 
exploration at present.         
Forensic  stylistics,  a  sub   -branch  of  forensic   
linguistics,  is  the  analysis  of  linguistic  differences  of 
written  language  in  dispute  (McMenamin,  2012).  As 
its  focus  is  on  the  consistent  and  varying  use  of 
language, the concentration of a legal document unde    r   
investigation  is  on  handwriting,  computer   -generated  
documents,  inks,  to  name  a  few.  While  forensic   
stylistics  is  something  new  as  far  as  stylistics  is 
concerned,  it  is  yet  a  fertile  ground  of  linguistic 
analysis,    as forensic linguistics is an emergent fi  eld of  
linguistic  studies  in  the  Philippines.  Concurrently, 
analyzing forensic or legal texts is actually receiving a 
growing  interest  or  popularity  (Cruz  &  Pariña,  2015) 
among linguists.    In addition,     studies on     the     authorship  
of legal English discourse ar   e an aspect which applied   
linguists, if not often, seldom put their attention to.         
Having  exposed  the  aforementioned,  this  paper  
addresses these gaps by investigating a linguistic facet 
of legal English discourse, i.e. adverbials, found in the 
Supreme  Court  decisions  in  Philippine  English 
(henceforth  PhE)  drafted  by  two  Supreme  Court 
jus tices  in  the  Philippines.  Vitally,  Finegan  (2012)     
asserts  that  adverbials  are  not     given   much    -paid   
consideration  as  far  as  legal  language  is  concerned. 
Judges’  dispositions  furthermore  manifest  in  the 
writing style they lay against Supreme Court decisions 
(Ambwani,  2015)     despite  the  detachment  expected  of     
them.  Likewise,  this  study  humbly  attempts  at 
analyzing  the  stylistics  of  adverbial  expressions  of

attitude  and  emphasis  in  Supreme  Court  decisions  in 
PhE and implicating its findings towards the pedagogy 
of English for Legal Purposes (ELP).        
This  paper  begins  with  a  discussion  of  legal     
discourse,  Supreme  Court  decisions,  and  Philippine 
English.  It  then  elucidates  on  adverbials  of  attitude 
and  emphasis  and  their  syntactic  features  and 
synthesizes  stylistic  a   nalyses  of  legal  documents.  
Subsequent  are  the  research  questions,  method, 
findings  and  discussion,  and  conclusion.  Apart  from 
the  study’s  implications  to  ELP,  it  also  emphasizes 
potential  directions  for  future  (forensic)  stylistics 
studies.        
 
Legal  disc ourse,  Supreme  Court  decisions,  and     
Philippine English      
Legal  discourse  like  academic  discourse  is  either 
spoken or written. Particularly, written legal discourse 
has  three  primary  genres  (  Krivchikova,  Koteneva,     
Sedykh,     & Trescheva,  2015  ):  (1)     the  laws   (e.g.   
Constitution,  foundations,  codes),  (2)  sub  -legislative    
statements (e.g. decisions, decrees, instructions, and so 
on),  and  (3)  scientific  special  legal  literature  (e.g. 
monographs,  textbooks,  legal  periodicals,  and  so  on)  .   
It is characterized by its p    eculiar lexical, syntactic, and     
graphological  features  (Alabi,  2011).  Filled  with 
foreign  terminologies,  the  legal  written  discourse  is 
wide    -ranging in terms of its lexemes. Latin and French  
loan  words  such  as   obiter,  habeas  corpus,  ratio     
decidendi,   and    commission  rogatoire    are  abundant.     
Similarly,  it  contains  abbreviations  like   V. for  versus,     
C.A.     for  Court  of  Appeal,    Div.  Ct    .  for  Division  Court,    
and     contra   for  an  authority  opposing  what  a  person  
has  stated.  Syntactically,  another  nuance  of  such 
discourse   is  its  word   -forming  peculiarity  as  the  use  of     
suffixes    –or and     –ee,    for  example,   mortgagor   ,  and  
mortgagee   . Stringing adverbs and prepositions to form    
new  words  is  also  common  such  as  there    and    to  
(thereto),   here    and    by (hereby),     and    where    and    of  
(whereof)   to name a few. Moreover, using modals like  
will     (as    a marker of futurity) and   shall   (as     a marker of     
futurity  and  imperativeness)  is  frequent.  It  is  the 
inversion  of  word  order  that  is  striking  in  legal  texts. 
The  j  uxtaposition  of  words  like   night  and  day,    
childbirth  and  pregnancy,  and    death  or  bodily  injury       
would  typically  appear  as    day  and  night,  pregnancy     
and  childbirth,     and    bodily  injury  and  death   reversely.     
That  arrangement  hints  the  important  points  to  be 
emphasized  so  a  client  would  not  fail  to  catch  the     
point being conveyed in the legal text. Long sentences 
are  usually  used  in  proceedings,  reports,  oaths   , and   
judgments  (Alabi,  2011).  Graphologically,  gothic 
writing  style  is  employed  also.  Bold  characters  are 
used  to  capture  exceptional  attention  and  i   ntroduce    
main paragraphs. Complex sentences typically are set    -   
off by either commas, semi  -colons, or entirely broken,    
or no punctuation are employed except periods (Alabi, 
2011).  Supreme  Court  decisions  are  just  one  of  the 
legal texts that possess these dis  tinctions.      
Being  a  sub   -legislative  legal  discourse,  Supreme    
Court  decisions  on  the  grounds  of  order  are  the  final 
product  of  court  proceedings.  While  its  style  differs 
from one judge to another, it reflects the disposition of 
a  judge  as  he  has  his  own  way    of  writing  (  Ambwani,    
2015    ).  Though  it  uses  legal  language,  it  should  be  
understood by individuals who lost in the case. In civil 
law,  according  to     Ambwani  (2015) ,  decisions  may  be   
long or short. Long and justified decisions are required 
in  original  suits  such  as  permanent  injunctions, 
contract  performance,  and  document  cancellations  to 
name a few. Short decisions are drafted in matters like 
review,  preliminary  iss   ues,  summary  suits,  and  so  on.     
Legally,    the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908  and  Code   
of  Criminal  Procedure,  1973  elucidate  the  tenets  for 
writing  judgments.  However,   Ambwani  (2015  )  argues   
that  decisions  still  have  the  judge’s  preference  to 
choose his languag  e and writing style. A judgment is a    
work  of  a  judge  who  acts  his  reasoning  and  provides 
truthful  opinions  that  the  appellate  Court  should 
discern  no  error  or  misleading  supposition.  It  also 
reflects  the  integrity,  fairness,  worthiness,  and 
intellectual  ho    nesty of a  judge  as an active  member of  
morally legal tradition. Legally, a decision should start 
with  accurate  presentation  of  facts,  root  of  case,  and 
the fashion in which the case reached the Court. While 
all  of  these  should  be  drawn  from  the  accounts  o   f   
Court  proceedings,  only  relevant     pieces  of  evidence    
and/or  narratives  must  be  expressed  precisely  and     
clearly .  Before  inscribing  the  findings  on  the   
judgment,  all  relevant    pieces  of  evidence  must  be  
deliberated  by  the  judges.  There  are  no  definite  rules 
as  to  how  a  finding  may  be  recorded,  but  the  judge 
should support his findings with reasons. This time, he 
has  to  be  guided  by  the  standards  of  drafting 
judgments  since  he  may  also  possess  preferences, 
predispositions, partiality, and subjectivity ( Ambwani ,   
2015    )  until  he  arrives  at  a  conclusion.  The  judgment    
can  be  drafted  plainly  and  simply.  Plain  and  simple 
English  language  involves  linguistic  features  not 
limited  to  reasonably  average  sentence  length,  short 
words,  no  double  negatives,  active  voice,  para    llel    
structure,  no  excessive  references  and  mazes,  and 
legalism  overuse.  All  of  this  adds  quality  to  the 
judgment,  and  whatever  legal  language  (orthodox  or 
plain)  through  which  it  is  expressed  speaks  the 
character  of  a  judge  (  Ambwani,  2015).     Generally,     
how ever, the  English language  is the  language  of law.  
Since  English  varies  in  one  language  domain  to 
another as it differs from one sociolinguistic context to 
another,  the  English  used  in  drafting  Court  decisions 
in the United States is definitely not the Eng  lish that is    
used  in  writing  Court  decisions  in  the  Philippines.

Thus,  Philippine  English  is  the  variety  of  English  that 
Filipino  judges  use  in  expressing  their  decisions  in 
Supreme Court judgments.        
While  trailblazing  syntactic  studies  of  PhE  were  
innovated by Llamzon    (1969), corpus  -based studies of   
PhE  using  the  International  Corpus  of  English     –   
Philippines  (ICE   -PHI)  can  be  officially  traced  in  
Bautista’s  monograph,  Defining  Standard  Philippine  
Engli   sh:  Its  Status  and  Grammatical  Structure    which  
describes  subject  -verb  concord,  tense  and  aspect,    
articles,  prepositions  in  PhE  (Bautista,  2000).  Since 
then, various local and foreign linguists succeeded and 
explored  the  syntactic  aspect  of  PhE.  Albeit  copi    ous     
studies  on  PhE  were  based  on  the  ICE -PHI,  profuse  
analyses  of  PhE  utilized  other  corpora  such  as 
academic essays (Yumul  -Florendo, 2012), newspapers    
(Hernandez,  2017;  Gustilo,  2011),  college  textbooks 
(Bernardo,  2013),  research  articles  (Gustilo,  2010),       
and  lesson  plans  (Peña,  1997)  had  been  undertaken. 
Any written discourse drafted by educated Filipinos is 
corpora of PhE that could be used as data for linguistic 
analyses.  According  to  Martin  (2014),  educated 
Filipinos  are  those  who  have  finished  their  f    ormal   
education, for example, bachelor, master, and doctoral 
degrees.  Hence,  legal  texts  such  as  Supreme  Court 
decisions written by Filipino judges and fiscals, which 
are  learned,  are  actually  PhE  corpora.  The  link 
between  Supreme  Court  decisions  and  PhE  r aises  an   
impetus for stylistic analyses focusing on adverbials of 
attitude and emphasis.      
 
Adverbials  of  attitude  and  emphasis ,  as  well  as     
their syntactic features        
Finegan  (2012)  argues  that  adverbials  are  interesting 
foci  of  inquiry  on  a  number  of  grounds.  As  they 
modify  three  content  words,  i.e.  verbs,  adjectives, 
adverbs,  and  entire  clauses,  thus,  they  show  notable 
syntactic  flexibility. Moreover, they signify att  itude or    
stance,  and  emphasis.  Adverbial  markers  that  signify 
attitudes  are,     appropriately,  correctly,  fortunately,    
unfortunately,  surprisingly,  remarkably,  inexplicably, 
importantly,  significantly,  happily,   properly   ,  and  
unfortunately    (Finegan,  2012).  For  example  (Finegan,     
2012, p. 72),       
    
Not surprisingly,    the parties vigorously disputed the    
waiver issue, and it sharply     divided the Court.     
The Court   inexplicably     concludes, however, that the   
liquefied natural gas (LNG) unloading wharf at stake 
in this litiga  tion “goes well beyond the ordinary or  
usual.   
    
Quirk  et  al.,  (1985)  treat  adverbs  of  attitude  as   
disjuncts  that  express  value  judgments  (Dita,  2011). 
Specifically,  “they  convey  some  evaluation  towards 
what  is  said”  (Quirk  et  al.,  1985,  p.  621),  and  are   
grouped  into  two:  the  first  is  the  adverbs  of  attitude 
that express an evaluation on what is stated as a whole 
in chorus to the subject of the clause. This occurs with 
judgments  either  passed  on  what  is  stated  as  true  or 
false  or  on  the  wisdom  of  what  is  d escribed.  The  
former  type  can  be   correctly,  incorrectly,  justly,   
unjustly,  rightly,     and  wrongly,   while  the  latter   can  be        
cleverly,  cunningly,  prudently,  reasonably,  sensibly, 
reasonably, wisely, unwisely     (Quirk et al., 1985).      
The second is the adverbs of    attitude that express   
judgment  carrying  the  absence  of  implication  to  the 
subject  of  the  sentence  or  clause.  Quirk  et  al.,  (1985, 
pp. 621 -622) illustrate,       
 
Remarkably,  Mrs. Jensen consulted her lawyer. [Her     
action was  remarkable; the speaker is not sugges   ting    
that Mrs. Jensen was remarkable]        
    
Besides  the  foregoing,  adverbs  that  take  no   
implication to their subjects can (a) judge  what  is said 
to be strange or unexpected (e.g.   amazingly, curiously,   
incredibly,  oddly,  remarkably,  strangely, 
suspiciously    ),  (b)  judge  what  is  said  to  be  expected    
(e.g.   appropriately,  inevitably,  naturally,  predictably,   
understandably  ),  (c)  judge  what  is  to  cause     
satisfaction  or  the  reverse  (e.g.   annoyingly,     
delightful  ly,  disappointingly,  disturbingly,  pleasingly,   
regrettabl  y), and (d) judge  what is said to be fortunate     
or  unfortunate  (e.g.  fortunately,  unfortunately,    
happily,  unhappily,  luckily,  unluckily,  sadly, 
tragically  ) (Quirk et al., 1985, p. 622).         
Adverbials  of  attitude  are  not  as  much  as    
adverbials  of  emphasis  (Fine gan,  2012)  in  legal  texts.  
What    are  more abundant are adverbials of emphasis or    
emphatic  adverbs  that  add  prominence  to  the  content 
but not alter it or do not modify content itself.   Simply,     
indeed,  merely,  clearly,  plainly,  precisely,  surely, 
readily,  of  c ourse,  particularly,  actually,  in  fact,     
certainly,  full,  especially,  highly   are  examples  
(Finegan,  2012).  For  instance,  Finegan  (2012,  p.  73) 
cites,      
    
But  when  discussing  these  words,  the  Court    simply      
ignores  the  preamble.  (But  when  discussing  these 
words,  the Court ignores the preamble.)        
It  is  particularly     appropriate  for  us  to  refrain  from    
employing  equal  protection  doctrine  to  thwart  the  will 
of the voters in this case.     
    
Speaking  of  content,  Quirk  et  al.,  (1985)  call   
adverbs  of  emphasis  as  content  disjuncts  that  can 
emphasize  a  degree  of  truth.    The  d  egree  of  truth    
content  disjuncts  provide s a  remark  on  the  truth  value  
of  what  is  stated;  expressing  the  extent  to  which  the 
author asserts that what he is saying is a fact. They can 
either  express  (a)  conviction  or  (b)  doubt.  Several 
adverbs  of  convictions  are   assuredly,  certainly,

Hernandez,  A (forensic) stylistic analysis of adverbials of    attitude and    ...     
458     
definitely,  indisputably,  surely,  unarguably, 
undoubtedly,  patently,  unquestionably,  clearly, 
evid    ently,  and  manifestly,    while  adverbs  of  doubt  are  
allegedly,  apparently,  conceivably,  most  likely, 
perhaps,  possibly,  presumably,  purportedly, 
reportedly, reputedly   , seemingly,    and  supposedly.        
While  these  disjuncts  are  placed  anywhere  in  a   
sentence,  Dita  (  2011)  explains  that  their  common    
positions  in  clauses  are  initial  (I),  medial  (M),  and 
final  (F).  Common  in  written  discourse,  they  are  set 
off  by  commas  from  the  clauses  they  belong;  hence, 
they  are  detached.    Dita  (2011,  p.  40)  cites  examples 
taken from  the ICE -PHI.       
 
Apparently,  someone  in  his  senior  moment  forgot  to 
give  you  the  corrected  direction...<W1B -014#108>   
(Initial)       
Pizza,  apparently,  has  already  found  her  true… 
<W1B    -006#101> (Medial)      
Well  it‘s  been  it‘s  been  functioning  as  a  hotel  also  uh 
apparently <S1B -038#60> (Final)        
        
In  addition,  they  appear  in  split  infinitives,  other     
functors, before  conjunctions, or  within a  noun phrase 
(Dita,  2011).  Dita  illustrates  them  as  follows  (Dita, 
201 1, pp. 40   -41).

Stylistic   analyses of legal documents     
Albeit  Finegan  (2012),  Quirk  et  al.  (1985),  and  Dita 
(2011)  give  detailed  and  clear  explications  about 
adverbials of attitude and emphasis, it seems that there 
has  been  uncharted  stylistic  analysis  as  regards  these 
adverbials in    Supreme  Court  decisions in PhE. This is  
actually  suggested  by  the  following  studies  driven  by 
the  macro levels of language:  graphology,  syntax, and 
lexicon  (Simpson,  2004).  By  far,  the  current  stylistic 
analyses  of  legal  texts  report  about  graphological, 
lexical, and syntactic features of legal discourse, while 
others  focus  on  their  microfeatures.  On  the  macro 
level,  Krivchikova     et  al.     (2015)  investigated  the   
stylistics  of  legislative  texts,  i.e.  grouped  into  three 
main  genres:  the  laws,  sub  -legislative  st    atements,  and  
scientific  special  legal  literature,  which  belong  to  the 
official    -business   -style.  Similar  to  other  styles  of     
written discourse, legislative texts are characterized by 
narrow  scope,  standardization,  expression  and   
imagery,  brevity  and  compactn    ess,  connectedness  and    
continuity,  impersonality  and  objectivity.  However, 
they  differ  in  terms  of  syntax,  archaism  , and   
conservatism.       
Relatively,  Feng  (2012)  discussed  the  stylistic    
features  of  legal  English  graphologically,  lexically, 
and  syntactically.  Graphologically,  legal  English  uses     
common  capitalization,  font  style,  and  font  size. 
Lexically, it is nuanced by archaisms, loan words from 
Latin  and  French,  and  technical  words.  Syntactically, 
it  utilizes  statements  and  complex  sentences.  These 
topograp    hies  of  legal  English  also  manifest  in  the   
study  of  Zhu  and  Wu  (2011)  who  examined  the 
stylistic  features  of  English  for  business  contracts 
from  both  a  lexical  and  syntactic  stance.  The  lexicon 
of  business  contracts  is  characterized  as  formal, 
archaic,  loa   n,  technical,  and  synonymous,  while  their  
syntax  shows  distinctiveness  in  terms  of  long 
sentences,  and  passive  voice.  Particularly,  Khan,  and 
Khan  (2015),  and  Nawaz,  Bilal,  Khan,  and  Ahmed 
(2013)  determined  the  stylistic  markers  and  (their 
communicative  fu   nctions  and  styles)  of  a  Supreme   
Court  judgment.  Through  graphological,  lexical,  and 
syntactic  analyses,  Nawaz  et  al.  arrived  at  a 
description  of  the  stylistics  of  the  legal  text.  At 
grapheme  level,  the  judgment  uses  lay  -out    
italicization,  and  bold  text,  c apitalization,  missing     
lines,  and  dots,  punctuation,  brackets,  and 
abbreviations.  Lexically,  the  text  uses  archaism, 
jargons,  enumeration,  and  any.  Syntactically,  the  data 
were  discovered  to  have  nominalizations,  unique 
determiners,  impersonality,  lengthy   and  complex    
sentences,  conditional  sentences,  prepositional 
phrases,  passives,  pre    -and  post  -modifications,     
negatives,  and  deviation  from  the  norm  of  legal 
language.       
On  the  micro  level,  Lisina  (2013)  contrasted  
English  and  Norwegian  stylistic  features  atyp  ical  to    
legal  written  discourse.  Complex  prepositions  and 
verbs  pairs  were  discovered  as  peculiar  to  both 
languages.  While  complex  prepositions  appear  in 
both,  they  are  more  frequent  in  Norwegian  texts. 
However, English legal texts use complex prepositions       
more consistently. Regarding verb pairs, English verbs 
have  neutral  connotations  but  are  formal  in  the 
Norwegian  counterpart.  Furthermore,  Cruz  and  Pariña 
(2015)  focused  on  the  subordinate  clauses  in  Court 
resolutions  drafted  by  two  Supreme  Court  justices  to     
determine  whether  the  clause  structures  used  by  the 
two  conform  to  the  nature  of  legal  written  discourse. 
Using  Quirk,  Greenbaum,  Leech,  and  Svartvik’s 
(1985)  types  of  subordinate  clauses  for  analysis,  they 
found  that  the  resolutions  adhere  to  legal  dr    afters’     
conventions  of  writing  legal  documents,  that  is,  using 
nominal  and  relative  clauses;  thus,  objective  and 
detached.

Research questions      
In  synthesis,  the  studies  above  imply  no  (forensic) 
stylistic  analysis  of  adverbial  expressions  of  attitude 
and  e  mphasis  in  Supreme  Court  decisions  in  PhE  has    
been made in the Philippine context. Linguists of legal 
discourse  infrequently  treat  adverbials  in  depth 
(Finegan, 2012). More  importantly, none  of the  above 
described  the  individual  authorship  of  the  legal 
dra fters  portrayed  in  the  corpus  they  had  written.  Of  
the  studies  explored  neither  the  adverbials  of  attitude  
and  emphasis  as  stylistic  markers  or  evidence  of  the 
customary  and  unconscious     selections,  which   an     
author  makes  in  his  writing  (McMenamin,  2012). Th e   
potential  of  Supreme  Court  decisions  in  PhE  for 
(forensic)  stylistic  analysis  cannot  be  devalued. 
Hence,  this  study  sheds  light  on  the  following 
questions:          
1.  What  are  the  classes  of  adverbials  of  attitude 
and  emphasis  in  Supreme  Court  decisions  in 
PhE?        
2.  What  are  the  placements  of  adverbials  of 
attitude  and  emphasis  in  Supreme  Court 
decisions in PhE?       
3.  What  environments  do  adverbials  of  attitude 
and  emphasis  in  Supreme  Court  decisions  in 
PhE appear?       
METHOD      
The  research  used  descriptive  qualitative  and 
quan    titative  research  designs.  The  frequencies  of  the     
two adverbials are presented, while they are supported 
by sentential extracts drawn from the linguistic data.          
Fifty   -four  (54)  authentic  Supreme  Court  
decisions in PhE on civil cases drafted by two Filipin  o   
Supreme Court   Chief Justices  , (1) Reynato Puno (RP),    
and  (2)  Renato  Corona  (RC)  were  purposively 
selected.  They  were  posted   on December  08,  2007  , to    
May 17, 2010    , during the term of RP, and    on May 17,  
2010    , to  May  29,  2012    , during  the  term  of  RC.  Other     
Supreme  Court  decisions  were  not  selected  since  they 
had been drafted by Associate Justices. In terms of the 
number  of  overall  tokens,  each  corpus  contains  more 
than 1000 to 5000 words.  In  sum, the  data  comprised 
of 160  .087 words.         
All  the    Supreme  Court  decisions  in  PhE  are     
actually  downloadable  online  at  
http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/.  As  they  are  virtually 
accessible,  the  researcher  copied  and  pasted  each  of 
them from the web    page to Text Document (.txt) since     
this is the only format that Ant    Conc and UAM Corpus     
Tool  (see  Data  analysis   below  for  description)  accept   
for  corpus  analysis.  Though  WordCounter  is  more 
flexible  as  it  accepts  a  variety  of  text  format s such  as  
Text  Document,  Microsoft  Word,  PowerPoint,  Excel, 
and  Portable  Document  Forma  t  (PDF),  the  .txt  format    
was  also  used  for  the  purpose  of  efficiency.  Each  text 
was  documented  through  assigning  a  specific  file 
name,  that  is,  LAST  NAME  OF  CHIEF  JUSTICE    -   
MONTH   -DAY    -YEAR  (e.g.  PUNO  -02 -15 -2008).  For    
decisions  that  have  identical  dates,  a  sma    ll  case  letter    
is  assigned  by  the  end  of  the  file  name  as  in  a,  b,  or  c 
(e.g. PUNO  -08 -12 -2008b). This  was done  until all the  
texts were completely collected.        
A  top  -down  approach,  the  framework  used  in  
analyzing  Supreme  Court  decisions  is  the  one 
provided     by  Finegan  (2012),  Quirk  et  al.  (1985),  and     
Dita (2011). Their descriptions regarding adverbials of 
attitude and emphasis were utilized as the bas  is for the  
investigation  of  the  said  stylistic  markers.  There  are 
four  categories  with  sub -categories  of  adve   rbials  
scrutinized  in  the  study:  (1)  adverbials  of  attitude,  i.e. 
(a)  evaluation  to  the  subject  of  the  clause,  and    (b)     
judgment  to  the  whole  clause;   (2)  adverbials  of     
emphasis,  i.e.     (a)  conviction,     and    (b)  doubt;  (3)    
placements  of  adverbials,  i.e.   (a)  init   ial,  (b)  medial,  
and  (c) final;  and environment in sentences, i.e.     (a) in  
split infinitive, (b) with functor, (c) before conjunction,     
and     (d)  within  a  noun  phrase.   These  categories  and  
sub -categories  were  discussed  above.  To  secure    
accuracy  of  analysis,  th e  researcher    performed  three   
rounds of coding.       
On  a  different  note,  the  physical  description  of     
the  two  sets  of  corpus  was  generated  and  counted 
through  the  aid  of  three  corpus  linguistics  tools: 
AntConc,  WordCount,  and  UAM  Corpus  Tool    –   
useful  computer  a pplications  in  analyzing  language    
features.  The  UAM  Corpus  Tool  strives  for  large 
corpora  in  which  rare  linguistic  features  can  be 
extracted,  features  such  as  parsing,  mood,  transitivity, 
theme  and  rheme,  modality,  and  tagging  that  linguists 
scrutinize (O’  Donnell, 2016). Conversely, WordCount   
is  a  web  -based  word,  character,  and  syllable  counter   
that  gives  a  broad  corpus  description.  It  also  includes 
readability,  and  keyword  density  (WordCounter, 
2017).  AntConc  is  for  concordancing  and  analyzing 
texts  (Antho   ny,  2014).  Aside  from  this,  AntConc    
gives  concordance  plot,  file  view,  clusters,  collocates, 
wordlist,  and  key  wordlist.  Through  these  softwares 
and  online  tool,  specific  adverbials  of  attitude  and 
emphasis  were  efficiently  located  in,  and  their 
frequency   count  was  easily  generated.  All  three  are     
manageable  to  use  even  without  much  training.  They 
had  helped  the  researcher  in  eliciting  underlying 
components  of  the  corpus  that  sometimes  may  not  be 
seen by an analyst’s naked eyes. Descriptive statistics, 
i.e.    weighted  average,  was  used  to  determine  the   
frequency and    percentages of the adverbials.       
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION         
Before providing the key findings, it is valuable to

present first the  physical  description of the  adverbials. 
In  the  interim,   Table   1  gives  the  summary  of  the     
corpus’  physical  description  by  average  number  of     
tokens  per  sentence,  total  number  of  sentences    ,  total    
number of tokens, and total number of adverbials.

Note: Table 1 shows the physical description of the Supreme Court decisions in   PhE.       
    
As  can  be  viewed,  RP’s  corpus  is  lengthier  as  it   
contains  97,  759  tokens  than  RC’s  .  Contrastingly,   
RP’s sentences are more complex having 9.71 average 
number of tokens per sentence than RC’s having 8.50. 
This  finding  is  supported  by  the  f    act  that  the  RP’s    
average number of sentences is 368.11 which is higher 
than  that  of  RC’s  315.48.  Legalese  sentences, 
according  to  Tiersma  (2000),     can  be  chunked  into  
smaller  pieces  without  compromising  the  content; 
thus,   Cruz  and   Pariña  (2015) assert that  complexity in   
legalese  sentences  may  be  superfluous.  It  can  be 
deduced  that  9.71  average  number  of  tokens  per 
sentence is digestible pieces comprising each sentence 
of  the  judgments  against  the  average  number  of  18 
words for sente nces to be understandable as argued by  
Strunk  and  White  (2000).     Generally,  RP’s  judgments     
somehow  lack  resemblance  as  evidenced  by  their 
scantly  higher  complexity  across  the  physical  aspects 
than  that  of  RC’s  judgments.    The  c  omplexity  of  RP’s     
Supreme  Court   decisions  is  furthermore  illustrated  as    
they  comprise  2,  166  adverbials  which  are  relatively 
higher than RC’s judgments that contain 1, 623 only.        
 
Classes     
Unlike  Quirk  et  al.  (1985)  and  Dita  (2011)  who 
provided  two  categories  of  adverbs  (i.e.   evaluation   to     
the  subject  of  the  clause,  and  judgment  to  the  whole   
clause  )  of  attitude,  the  current  study  discovered   
another  that  is   evaluation  to  an  action  performed  by   
the  subject  of  the  clause.  Correctly   (13  occurrences),  
importantly     (10  occurrences),  necessarily     (15     
occurrences),  and  personally   (28  occurrences)  are  the    
most repetitive among the 22 adverbials. Both RC and 
RP’s  writing  styles  illustrate  resemblance  as  the 
classifications  of  those  four  adverbials  they  use  are 
similar,  while  they  also  pose  variations    in  one  way  or   
another.  Due  to  RP’s  higher  number  of  adverbials  of 
attitude (i.e. RP   -36.97% over RC -17.24%; RP -20.17%     
over  RC    -18.49%;  RP    -26.72%  over  RC   -12.07%),  he   
may  be  assessed  as  a  judge  who  is  more  attached  to 
his  writings  disparate  of  RC.  This  is  mor    e  revealed  in     
his  use  of    personally  .    When  evaluating  an  action   
being  performed  by  the  subject  of  the  clause,  RP 
utilized  the  term  16  times  that  is  four  notches  higher 
than  RC’s  which  is  12  times  only.  Two  cases  in  point 
are

In  addition,  RP  uses     correctly   frequently  for     
judging  the  whole  clauses  and  evaluating  the  action 
done by the subject of the clause, unlike RC. Instances 
are as follows.     
 
PUNO    -050708.txt

dishonest  official,  even  if  he  performs     his  duties

(Judgment to the whole clause)      
 
Quite  similarly,  RP  utilizes     importantly  when   
both  evaluating  the  action  done  by  the  subject  of  the 
clause,  and  giving  judgment  to  the  entire  clause, 
wherea  s  RP  uses  the  adverb  only  when  judging  the  
whole clause. For example,

more    importantly ,  by   Respondents  own  judicial  
admission.      
(Evaluation to the subject of the clause    )   
 
As  for     necessarily,    RP  often  employs  it  when    
evaluating  an  action  performed  by  the  subject  of  the 
clause.  He  occasionally  uses  it  when  judging  the 
whole  clause.    It  is  marked  in  his  corpus  since  it  is 
absent  in  the  writings  of  RC  across  the  three  classes. 
This  may  be  represen ting  his  distinctive  authorship.     
Extracts are illustrated as follows.

(Evaluation  to  an  action  performed  by  the  subject  of 
the clause  )   
        
Conviction  and  doubt  are  the  classes  of   
adverbials  of  emphasis  found  in  the  texts.  Adverbials 
of  conviction  (365  cases)  outnumbered  adverbials  of 
doubt  (79  cases).  This  can  be  explained  by  the  legal 
tenet  that  justices  have  to  establish  authority  and 
insti   tute  command  in  writing  decisions;  thus,   
skepticism  against  the  case  of  the  judgments  is 
discouraged  and  expected  of  them.  Notably,  RP  uses 
more  adverbials  of  conviction  than  RC  as  the  first 
occurred  214  times  while  the  latter  came  about  151 
times  only.  RP    ,  then,  demonstrates  greater  conviction     
than  RC  by  using  multiple  adverbials  of  emphasis. 
Most  recurrent  conviction  adverbials  of  emphasis  are 
clearly     (i.e.  RP   -7.40%  over  RC    -7.40%),    in  fact    (i.e.   
RP  -7.67%  over  RC    -3.84%) ,  indeed   (i.e.  RP   -6.30%  
over  RC    -4.66%  ),  merely  (i.e.  RP   -6.58%  over  RC    -   
2.74%)  , and    fully  (i.e. RP    -5.48% over RC  -3.29%) .  As   
RP  uses  more  adverbials  of  conviction  over  RC,  his 
samples are as follows.

On  the  other  hand,  those  that  signify  doubt  are     
allegedly,  apparently,  presumably,  likely,  maybe, 
purportedly,    and  supposedly.    Among  these,   allegedly       
is  the  most  intermittent  as  it  occurs  52  times  far  and        
beyond  the  other  six.  Likewise,  it  is  unquestionably  a 
legal term in forensic science as it is used habitually in 
the  Supreme  Court  decisions  in  PhE.  As  can  be  seen, 
both  RC  (39  occurrences)  and  RP  (40  occurrences) 
write using adverbials emphasizing doubt    . While all of  
these  adverbials  can  be  synonymous  in  meaning  and 
context,    allegedly    suggests  that  the  two  judges  use  it  
as  the  most  legalistically  appropriate  adverbial  of 
conviction  among  the  seven  as  in  the  succeeding 
extracts.

Placements      
Strikingly,  RP  places  adverbials  of  attitude  in  the 
middle  of  sentences,  having  69.23%  that  is  81 
occurrences     – doubly  higher  than  RC,  having  34.19%     
that is 40 hits. In spite of this, RC’s medial positioning 
of  adverbials  outnumbered  his  and  RP’s  initial 
placement  of  adverbs.      Thus,  one  dominant  stylistic 
feature  of  RP  and  RC  when  writing  Supreme  Court 
decisions  is  their  medial  position  of  adverbials  and 
that  they  less  frequently  place  them  in  the  initial 
position.  However,  RC’s  medial  placement  of  these 
adverbials  is  more  abundant.  For  the  initial  position, 
the most recurring ones are     correctly, importantly,     and     
necessarily.    For  the  medial,   personally,     having  27  
frequencies,  is  the  most  occurring  style  marker.  Its 
remarkable  frequency  may  be  deduced  from  w    hat     
McMenamin  (2012)  noted  that  judges  may  also 
transcend  their  subjective  disposition  into  their 
writings of Court judgments. For example,

Initially  and  medially,   necessarily     transpired  in  
RP’s corpus only. Its 14 (11.97%)  med  ial occurrences     
are  far  more  than  its  initial  position  of  1  (0.85%) 
respectively. Hence,    necessarily  is another contrasting     
stylistic  feature  of  RP  which  was  not  evident  in  the 
writings of RC. Here are the examples.

Comparatively,  both  adverbials  of  attitude  and     
emphasis are rem    arkably visible in the medial position  
as  RP  and  RC  employ  many  of  both  adverbials  in  the 
middle of sentences.        
Both  initial  and  medial  positions  were  observed   
in  the  judgments.  Contrastingly,  both  judges  very 
frequently  place  their  adverbials  of  emphasis  in  the     
medial  position.  RP’s  adverbials  in  the  medial  have 
201  or  46.96%,  while  RC’s  have  150  or  35.05%. 
Clearly,  allegedly,  indeed,  in  fact,  merely,   and  fully  
are  the  most  frequent  ones.     Clearly  and    allegedly.      
being the most frequent, have 64.15% equivale   nt to 54    
occurrences.  Both  indeed   and    in  fact    are  equally    
occurring  as  they  have  51.81%  (42  cases).  This  is 
succeeded  by   merely  that  has       41.94%  (34     
occurrences),  then,    fully    that  has  27.14%  (22     
occurrences).  Albeit  differences  of  frequencies  that 
can  be  seen  on  and  between  the  judges,  these  are  but 
little  variations  only.  It  can  be  inferred  that  both  of 
their  writing  styles  conform  to  the  legal  writing 
convention that judges  should display certainty in their   
legal  judgments  so  it  would  lead  to  no  sign  of  qualm 
from  Appel late  court  and  other  legal  bodies  
(Ambwani,  2015 ).  As  both  adverbials  of  attitude  and     
emphasis  appear  right  before  the  specific  points, 
entities,  or  events  the  y  modify,  the  two  Chief  Justices   
attempt  at  revealing  strong  precision  in  their 
conviction  and/or  doubt  on  the  facts  they  present  and 
argue.  In  Supreme  Court  decisions,  regular  medial 
position  of    adverbials   therefore  signifies  accuracy  in     
writing.  Below,  t he  robustness  of  using  these  adverbs   
of  emphasis  is  illustrated  by  the  extracts  with  adverbs 
italicized. The points they modify are underlined.

placements  of  adverbs  of  attitude  and  emphasis  are 
consistent  and     resembling  in  RP  and  RC,  their     
frequencies  are  much  distant  from  each  other.  It  can 
be  construed  that  both  judges  have  unique  stylistic 
variations.         
    
Environments        
While  there  are  four  environments  of  both 
adverbials:     in split infinitive, with functor or function   
word,  before  conjunction,  and  within  a  noun  phrase 
(Dita,  2011)   ,  the  researcher  however  discovered     
three  more  categorized as     before/after the  verb, after   
an  intensifier,     and    n/a  which  refer  to  adverbials  that     
are in the initial position evaluating the  whole clause 
and appear before the subject of the sentence.  n/a  has    
been  used  to  avoid  confusing  it  with  the  classes  of 
adverbials  of  attitude  and  emphasis.  RP  and  RC’s 
adverbials  are  situated  within  particular 
env ironments  with  relatively  high  and  low     
frequencies.  Importantly,  the  ones  that  have  greater 
frequencies  have  to  be  emphasized  as  they  are 
suggestive  of  the  recurrence  of  writing  style.  RP’s  
with functor     has the highest frequency, that is 26% of  
all  the  adv   erbials  of  attitude.  RP’s    before/after  the   
verb     having  19.8%  is  second.  Subsequent  is  RC’s   
before/after  the  verb  having  12.1%  succeeded  by   
RP’s    with  functor   that  has  9.5%.  Thus,  RP’s   
environments  of  his  adverbials  of  attitude 
particularly    with  functor,  and  RC’s    environments  of   
his  adverbials  specifically   before/after  the  verb  can    
be  said  as  their  natural  milieus.  Supporting  this, 
McMenamin  (2012)  reveals  that  authors  reflect  their 
unconscious  manner  of  writing  onto  their  written 
papers. Extracts are as foll    ows.

The  first  two     extracts  exemplify     with  functor    as     
personally   and    necessarily.    They  are  surrounded  by   
function  words     either   and    or,  that  are  conjuncts,  for     
personally  ,  and  must     (modal)  and   be (copula)  for    
necessarily .  Conversely,  the  second  two  have  verbs   
succeeded  by   personally   and    necessarily . Personally        
is  placed  before  delivered   ,  while    necessarily  is     
situated before     forfeits    .   
As  regards  the    environments  of  adverbials  of    
emphasis,  more  adverbs  of  emphasis  have  greater 
number of frequencies.  They are generally surrou   nded    
by all environments provided by Dita (2011). In detail, 
these are   before/after the verb, after an intensifier, n/a    
(that  means  the  same  as  that  for  adverbials  of 
attitude),  before  an  infinitive  phrase,  before  a 
prepositional  phrase,  and  before  a  claus   e.  More    
specifically,   with  functor,  within  a  phrase/clause,   
before/after  the  verb,  and  n/a  have  the  paramount    
number  of  occurrences;  they  take  in  pairs 
simultaneously.     With  functor    of  RP  (22.2%)  and  RC   
(17.86%)  takes  the  highest  frequency  as  it  is  the  most     
recurrent  of  all  the  environments  that  have  the  most 
dominance.  Within  a  noun  phrase/clause  ranks    the    
second  with  RP  having  14.8%  and  RC  having  8.67%.

adverbials  of  emphasis,  are  the  relatively  identifiable 
stylistic features of the two Filipino judges in terms of 
sentence environment.       
 
Implications to  ELP        
After  making  an  attempt  of  stylistically  analyzing  the 
two types of adverbials in Supreme  Court decisions in 
PhE  drafted  by  the  two  Chief  Justices,  this  study 
anticipated  that    one  may  ask  how  do  these  stylistic   
aspects,  i.e.  classes,  placements,  and  e   nvironments  of     
adverbial  expressions  of  attitude  and  emphasis 
implicate  the  pedagogical  dimension  of  ELP?  It  is 
noteworthy  to  emphasize  the  pedagogical  associations 
of these stylistic features toward (1) ELP professors or 
teachers,  (2)  law  students  and/or   student  lawyers,  and  
(3) educated readers of Supreme Court decisions.        
First,  teachers  of  ELP  may  be  provided  with  
specific  foci  of  teaching  adverbials  of  attitude  and 
emphasis  in  the  ELP  classroom.  They  could  divide 
these  foci  into  three  as  in  classes,  pl  acements,  and  
environments  in  that  they  can  teach  these  aspects  one 
at  a  time  to  their  law  students.  Also,  they  may  utilize 
the  research  interpretations  and  cited  extracts  given 
here  as  instances  of  authentic  language  for  teaching 
forensic  written  discours e.  As  revealed  by    
McMenamin  (2012)  and  Finegan  (2012),  the  two 
adverbials  are  not  given  much  attention  in  forensic 
discourse. Therefore, it may be necessary now to teach 
these  micro    -syntactic  items  in  the  ELP  classroom.  As     
it is, law students     and/or studen   t lawyers   may learn the   
stylistics  of  the  two  adverbials  in  Supreme  Court 
decisions  drafted  in  PhE.  Learning  them  could 
increase their repertoire in practicing writing this legal 
document.   Ambwani,  (2015 )  once  noted  that  judges    
who  are  given  tasks  that  include  writing  Court 
opinions  should  learn  the  appropriate  fashion  of 
writing  them.  Studying  the   three  aspects  of  the  two    
adverbials  may  supplant  such  a  gap  among  legal

drafters  of  Court  judgments.  Further    more,  students     
could  decide  which  among  these  would  best  suit  the 
points  or  claims  they  need  to  assert  and  accentuate 
with  respect  to  their  conviction  or  doubt  in  practicing 
writing  Supreme  Court  judgments.  Thirdly,  educated 
readers may be informed about t he underlying stylistic     
explanations  on  their  uses.  It  is  univocally  important 
that  they  should  also  have  the  knowledge  about  their 
classes,  placements,  and  environments;  thus,  making 
sense  of  the  linguistic  behavior  of  the  two  adverbials 
in Supreme Court    decisions.          
 
        
CONCLUSION      
To  the  best   knowledge   of  the  researcher’s  and  his     
endeavor  of  searching  for  forensic  linguistics  studies 
in  the  Philippines,  he  has  found  a  dearth  of  research 
especially  on  adverbials  of  attitude  and  emphasis  in 
legal  documents.    Equally  important  is  the  fact  that    
these  two  adverbials  are  given  less  attention  in 
forensic  linguistics  (McMenamin,  2012;  Finegan, 
2012)   . More  likely,  forensic  stylistics  studies  in  the     
Philippines  require  resilient  initiation     to offer  ELP   
teachers,  law  students,    and/or  student  lawyers,  and     
educated  readers  the  writing  style  of  justices  in 
drafting  court  decisions.  Therefore,  this  paper 
(forensically)  stylistically  analyzed  the  classes, 
placements, and environments of the two adverbials in 
Supreme  Court  d   ecisions  in  PhE  written  by  two     
Filipino Chief Justices.        
Three classes  were  determined: e  valuation to the    
subject  of  the  clause,  judgment  to  the  whole  clause,        
and     evaluation  to  an  action  performed  by  the  subject     
of the  clause  .  Adverbials of attitude  such as  correctly,  
importantly, necessarily,    and    personally   were the most  
frequent among the 22 adverbial expressions. RP’s use 
of  personally  , being the most frequent in evaluating an  
action  being  performed  by  the  subject  of  the  cl ause,   
suggests  his  attachment  when  evaluating  action  and 
subject  in  Supreme  Court  decisions.  Moreover, 
necessarily  was  marked  in  RP  as  it  was  absent  in  the  
writings  of  RC  across  the  three  classes.  Thus,  this 
entails  RP’s  writing  exhibits  further  certainty 
compared to the writing of RC.  In contrast, adverbials 
of  conviction   outnumbered  adverbials  of    doubt   .  RP   
demonstrates  greater  conviction  than  RC  by  using 
more  multiple  adverbials  of  emphasis.  Most  recurrent 
conviction  adverbials  of  emphasis  were  clearly,    in  
fact, indeed, merely,    and    fully   , while the most frequent   
adverbial  of  doubt  was   allegedly   .  While  most  of  the     
adverbials  of  doubt  were  utilized  by  the  judges, 
allegedly   ,  having  the  paramount  occurrence   
simultaneous  with  their  proximity  of  frequencies, 
suggests  that  the  two  judges  use  it  as  the  most 
legalistically appropriate adverbial of doubt among the 
rest.  Regarding  placements,  one  prevailing  stylistic   
feature  of  the  two  judges  is  that  they  placed  both 
adverbials  medially,  and  initially.  Hence,  both 
adverbials  act  right  before  the  points  they  refer  to 
which  may  be  attributed  to  the  justices’  attempt  at 
displaying  exactitude  in  their  conviction  and/or  doubt 
on the claims they present through their authorship. In 
the  written discourse of Court decisions,  therefore, the  
use  of  medial  placement  of  adverbials  indicates 
truthfulness  in  writing.  While  there    are  consistency    
and  resemblance  on  the  medial  placement  of  adverbs 
of attitude  between  RP and RC, it can be  inferred that 
both  judges  have  unique  stylistic   variations  since  the  
frequencies  of  their  respective  medial  positions  are 
much  distant  from  each  other.  They  place  their 
adverbials  within  particular  adverbial  environments 
with  relatively  high  and  low  frequencies.  In  stylistic 
perspective,  RP’s  attitudina  l  adverbial  environments  
particularly    with  functor,   and  RC’s  before/after  the   
verb    can  be  said  as  their  respective  tendency  of  
distinct  authorships.  Such  environments  are  therefore 
suggestive of their varied writing styles.      
While  the  findings  are  fairly  so   und  and  the   
interpretations  understandable,  some  research 
trajectories  could  still  be  determined  and  further 
undertaken.  One  is  that  future  studies  may  involve 
forensic  discourse  analysis  in  scrutinizing  other 
linguistic  dimensions  of  the  discourse  of  Supr    eme     
Court  judgments  such  as  clauses,  passives,  and  so  on. 
Another  is  a  different  legal  written  discourse  may  be 
examined  in  terms  of  the  adverbials  explored  in  this 
study  or  other  types  of  adverbs  even,  and 
contrast/compare  its  findings  to  the  results  of  t    his     
paper.  Doing  this  may  pave  way  to  revealing 
authorship  variations  in  different  written  legal 
discourses.  Univocally,  a  researcher  may  delve  into 
utilizing  more  corpus  linguistics  tools  in  analyzing 
forensic  texts.  The  researcher  hopes  that  this  study 
would  provide  a  positive  contribution  to  the  field  of 
forensic  stylistics  in  the  Philippines  and  that  it  may 
inspire  applied  linguists  in  exploring  legal  genres       
(forensically) stylistically    . As forensic linguistics is an     
emerging field in the Philippines, t    here are  more to be    
investigated today and in the future.

ABSTRACT    
Despite the large ecological study of tree-climbing mangrove sesarmid crabs in other 
countries, the Philippine representatives appear to have not been investigated extensively. 
This paper presents the feeding ecology as to dependence on mangrove trees of sesarmids in 
different mangrove areas of southern Luzon. This is biased on the nature of the crab habitats, 
arboreal climbing skills and burrowing behavior of the sesarmids:  Selatium elongatum and 
Episesarma versicolor − exclusive mangrove tree climbers (EMTC); Sarmatium germaini − 
occasional mangrove tree climber (OMTC); and the non-mangrove tree-climbing (NMTC) 
sesarmids- Neosarmatium smithii, Perisesarma bidens and Perisesarma eumolpe.
Key words:    mangrove crabs, sesarmid crabs, climbing skills, burrowing skills, arboreal climbing 
crabs, Catanduanes, Philippines 
INTRODUCTION    
The crustaceans (e.g. brachyurans) are always a prominent and diverse element 
of the fauna in mangals (Morton 1990). Crabs are diverse in mangrove habitats and 
abundant in many mangals (Jones 1984). Several authors (e.g. Jones 1984, Lee 1998) 
have attested that brachyurans are important in the mangrove ecosystem structure and 
function. Unfortunately, it appears that there is still a dearth of detailed published 
information on the occurrence of several families of this group of crustaceans in the 
mangrove areas of the Philippines. Moreover, there seems to be limited published 
data on the ways in which these faunal elements use the mangrove resources. The 
sesarmids are less documented in the Philippines unlike in other countries, wherein 
several reports are available from Singapore (Sivasothi 2000; Sivasothi et al. 1993; 
Tan & Ng 1994; Ng & Liu 1999) Malaysia (Tan & Ng 1994; Leh & Sasekumar 
1985), Indonesia (Soemodihardhjo & Soerianegara 1989; Rahayu & Davie 2002), 
Hong Kong (Poovatchiranon 1986; Lee & Leung 1993; Lee 1998; Lee 1997; Kwok 
1995; Kwok & Tang 2005; and Ashton 2002).
Crabs have different functions and impacts on the mangrove ecosystem. Firstly, 
they can process as much as 70% of the leaf litter, and leaf processing can turn over 
a litter at a rate in excess of 75 minutes (see studies of Leh & Sasekumar, 1985; Slim

2   
BIOTROPIA Vol. 16 No. 1, 2009   
et al. 1997; Dahdouh-Guebas et al. 1999; Ashton 2002). Secondly, most mangrove 
crabs feed on vascular plant materials, but they also feed on green leaves (Lee 1998; 
Skov & Hartnoll 2002), including seedlings. Mangrove plant seedlings grazing, 
particularly in the genus Sesarma may also slow regeneration of mangroves. On the 
other hand, grapsoid crabs are the primary seed operators. Emmerson & McGwynne 
(1992) described the feeding and assimilation of mangrove leaves by the crab Sesarma 
meinerti. Moreover, the feeding ecology of Neosarmatium smithii was studied by 
Giddins et al. (1986) and new records from Taiwan on this sesarmid crab was reported 
by Naruse et al. (2006).
The crabs of the family Sesarmidae are known by various workers to have 
significant ecological role in mangals (Lee 1998, Gillikin 2000; Gillikin & Schubart 
2004, Gillikin et al. 2004). Many species of these mangrove crabs do not assimilate 
much carbon from the mangrove leaves but rely on the sediments (Bouillon et al. 
2002, Skov & Hartnoll 2002). Some species of the genus Perisesarma supplement 
their diet with leaves (Leh & Sasekumar 1985, Slim et al. 1997). Hence, this aspect 
on the feeding ecology of sesarmid crabs helps to trap the energy stored in these 
leaves within the mangal before the tide can carry them away ( Lee 1998; Skov & 
Hartnoll 2002). 
Despite the large ecological study of mangrove sesarmids in other countries 
(Bright & Hogue 1972; Hartnoll 1975; Micheli, Gherardi & Vannini 1991; Cannicci 
et al. 1996; Slim et al. 1997; Dahdouh-Guebas et al. 1999; Fratini, Cannicci & 
Vannini 2000, Flores et al. 2003) the Philippine representatives appear to have not 
been investigated extensively. This study on the patterns of biodiversity in aquatic 
systems of the Philippines attempted to determine the feeding ecology of selected 
taxa of sesarmids as to (a) the nature of the crab habitats in the mangrove forest with 
reliance to the mangrove trees, trunks, roots, and leaves that offer a wide variety of 
ecological niches for the species under consideration; and (b) the behavior of the 
sesarmid crabs as revealed by their burrowing abilities and tree-climbing skills needed 
to explain the reliance of these crabs on the mangrove forest.  
MATERIALS AND METHODS   
Study sites
The collection and observation sites of the study include: I- Palsabangon 
Mangrove Area in Pagbilao, Quezon, Philippines; II - Maqueda Channel in the Bicol 
Region, Agojo Inlet Mangrove Reserve Area, San Andres and Palnab-Pajo Mangrove 
Area, Catanduanes, Philippines. 
Feeding ecology as to dependence on mangroves, arboreal climbing skills and 
burrowing behavior  
Specimens of mangrove crabs were collected by handpicking and with the use 
of scoop nets and locally made traps. Collections were made both in the morning 
and in the evening from the mangrove areas along rivers, creeks, inlets and the buffer 
zones or marginal strips of the coastline in one site each for the study areas from June 
2005 to February 2006.

Ecological studies on feeding behavior took place in the purposively selected 
study plots in Palnab-Pajo Mangrove Swamp, Catanduanes during the months of 
October and December in 2005, while in the mangrove areas of Palsabangon in 
Pagbilao, Quezon studies were done from January to February 2006. Ecological 
studies of sesarmids were carried out in each of the mangrove areas following the 
methods of Gillikin (2000). In the selected mangrove forests, presence or absence 
of crab species were determined by visual inspection in 10 m diameter plots along 
a transect perpendicular to the coastline, covering the full width of the forest. The 
study investigated at least 10 plots along a 100 to 200 m long transect in the areas 
under study. 
Emergence and re-emergence of the sesarmids 
During fieldwork, each plot was first inspected using binoculars from a distance 
of approximately 6 m for 20 min. and the crab species recognized were noted and 
recorded. Afterwards, naked eye observations were undertaken with two field workers 
(observers) sitting on opposite sides of the plot for at least 30 min, following Hartnoll 
et al. (2002) and Skov et al. (2002). As a modification, the researcher and field 
assistants were positioned in two separate paddled boats (“banca”) when the plots 
were observed. The researcher approached the plot and a disturbance was created 
(either by throwing some mud, twigs or branches of mangrove plants) so that the 
sesarmids, under study take refuge in the burrows, or holes, and other materials to 
take cover (e.g. leaves, wood, twigs etc.). The time at which the first individual of 
the sesarmids will emerge or re-emerge was recorded. Observations for this portion 
of the study were undertaken during the day at low tides. Diurnal and lunar cycles 
were not used in the distinction of the observation. The aforementioned procedures 
are modifications of the works of Gillikin (2000), Hartnoll et al. (2002) and Skov 
et al. (2002).  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Reliance on the mangroves as habitats
Table 1 shows the summary of the observations made on the habitats of various 
grapsoid sesarmid crabs in the mangals of Catanduanes Island and Pagbilao, Quezon. 
The nature of their habitat, climbing abilities and burrowing skills could explain the 
feeding ecology of the mangrove crabs under investigation.

Episesarma versicolor feed on calyx and leaves and crop on leaf litters, then 
bring fragments to the burrows. The grapsoid sesarmid crabs, Perisesarma spp. and 
Episesarma sp. were found to be herbivores and omnivore/deposit feeders, eating 
mangrove litter and water plants. Moreover, the sesarmid crabs Sarmatium germaini 
(Figure 1), Perisesarma eumolpe and Neosarmatium smithi feed on the mangrove litter, 
composed of fallen mangrove leaves of Rhizophora, seedlings, calyx and twigs that 
fall from the trees on the forest floor and into the water. This study confirmed that 
the leaves of the mangroves, R. marina, R. apiculata, and Ceriops tagal were devoured 
by the generally observed herbivorous/omnivorous crabs such as Perisesarma spp. 
The feeding habits of mangrove crabs have been divided into seven groups by Jones 
(1984): herbivore, carnivore, omnivore, deposit feeder, omnivore/deposit feeder, 
specialized filterer, and filterer/omnivore. In the study of Islam & Uehara (2005), 
stomach content analysis showed that P. bidens diet consists mainly of mangrove leaves 
fragments, with small amounts of animal, algae and sediment matters, indicating that 
this sesarmid is primarily detritivorous. 
In Chiromanthes onychophorum, Malley (1998) noted that this sesarmid crab 
consumes fallen leaves or their fragments, incompletely digests them, and returns 
them to the environment as fecal matter in a more finely-divided state than when they 
were ingested.  Of recent, Ya et al. (2008) reported that both Perisesarma eumolpe and 
P. indiarum are mainly sediment grazers, but also feed on mangrove leaves and roots 
and occasionally animal matter.  These crab species prefer Avicennia alba leaves to 
other mangrove species, i.e., A. officinalis, A. rumphiana, R. apiculata  and Bruguiera 
gymnorhiza. 
Dahdouh- Guebas (1997), Ashton (2002), Buck et al. (2003), Thongtham 
& Kristensen (2003) and Schwamborn et al. (2006) analyzed the diets of sesarmid 
crabs showed that their diet mainly consisted of mangrove leaves and in addition to 
bustle animal matter.

Burrowing and arboreal climbing skills of sesarmids
Similar with other sesarmids, P. bidens are burrowers, but observations made 
in Quezon and Catanduanes indicate that some individuals tend to hide in natural 
refuges found in the mangals investigated. These hiding places are the crevices of rocks 
and boulders and in between portions of root buttresses of mangrove trees.
Field observation in Quezon, indicates that these crabs are also having preferences 
in arboreal environments wherein Selatium elongatum and Episesarma versicolor were 
seen clinging on mangrove stems or rush to the mangrove stems when disturbed, 
while the boat is cruising in the waterways. These tree climbing crabs appear to be 
less antagonized during the investigation and remained to be motionless for about 1 
hour. When tides are rising or lowering, these crabs appear to be unaware as observed 
for at least an hour. However, when the rising tide reaches their location in any of the 
protruding branches of the mangrove trees in the embankments, these tree-climbing 
crabs tend to adjust or move slowly with their heads upside down. Researches indicate 
the possibility that these crabs cling to the mangrove stems not to find food but 
as avoidance from very long immersion in the water during high tides and due to 
the presence of predators. This could not be confirmed in the study. During field 
observation, it was rather easy to find P. bidens in the open sand or mudflats. 
Behavioral differences between the male and female samples of P. bidens was 
observed. On the sexes, results of initial experiment suggest that there is no difference as 
to the aggressiveness. However, the males are more receptive to antagonistic encounters, 
especially when disturbed inside the aquarium prior to feeding observation. It was 
difficult for the researcher to catch this sesarmid due to its swiftness and alertness. 
One striking character of this crab is its fast action in retreating from external stimuli 
such as touch or other mechanical disturbance. This could be the reason why the 
feeding experiment did not proceed because the individuals of P. bidens placed in 
the glass aquaria did not feed on the pieces of R. apiculata, R. mucronata, A. marina 
and other associated mangrove plants. 
However, the report of Ólafsson et al. (2002) cited that male and female crabs 
are likely to have different energy requirements, due to differences in the energetic 
costs of producing eggs or sperm (Michell 1993). A study of Kyomo (1992) conducted 
on the sesarmid crab Sesarma intermedia showed that females were more specialized 
in their feeding habits and had higher assimilation rates than males.

N. smithii form burrows around R. mucronata and R. apiculata roots but rarely 
in Avicennia marina found in the mangals of Catanduanes.  Observations indicate 
that N. smithi feed on leaf litter but also some shrimps, specifically Palaemonetes sp. 
This was observed during the afternoon hours when tides start to rise. 
Observation on emergence and re-emergence of sesarmids in the burrows 
In general, P. bidens appears to be the most active of the three sesarmids observed 
during the day. As shown in Table 2, the red-clawed grapsoid sesarmid crab, P. bidens 
emerged and re-emerged from the burrows much faster (mean of 3.48 mins) than 
the sesarmids N. smithi (mean of 4.15 mins) and E. versicolor (3.93 mins). All three 
sesarmid crab species display similar behavior of picking up the leaf fragments by 
first standing still in motionless for about 7 to 10 seconds. Some sesarmids, e.g  E. 
versicolor has to consume the leaf fragment where they found it, then migrate for at 
leas 0.5 meters  and to be continued at the mouth of the burrows. Some crabs move 
away from the areas where they got the leaf fragments and continue feeding near the 
burrows. Some bring these fragments inside the burrows but mostly will have the 
tendency to leave behind when disturbance was made.
There is much to be learned as to the sesarmid crab’s feeding ecology in the 
Philippines since there are various similarities and differences in the findings of other 
authors. Some researchers report on the unusual presence or occurrence as to their 
level of dependence in the different habitats, arboreal or burrows. Climbing skills and 
burrowing abilities also vary depending on the species. While others focus on how 
sesarmids rush to the mangrove tree and and cling to the branches, it is still unknown 
whether they are apparently resting or catching some insects or invertebrates. Other 
researchers put premium on their occurrence in the mudflats or soft sediments of 
mangals for feeding on some leaf litter. Moreover, the sesarmids under study have 
been observed cropping and bustling on sand sediments and other fragments of 
leaf litter that some crab ecologists might have ignored  and do not give emphasis. 
Further studies can be carried out in the future in terms of the feeding ecology of 
these vital species of mangrove crabs in relation to morphological variation of the 
feeding apparatus. Lastly, deeper reflections on the notions of convergent evolution 
(Fratinni et al. 2005) and the timing of development in relation to arboreal climbing 
skills and burrowing abilities of sesarmids deserve further attention.

CONCLUSIONS 
Based on the results presented, Selatium elongatum and Episesarma versicolor are 
exclusive mangrove tree climbers (EMTC); Sarmatium germaini as occasional mangrove 
tree climber or OMTC; and the sesarmid species − Neosarmatium smithii, Perisesarma 
bidens and Perisesarma eumolpe as non-mangrove tree climbers or NMTC. The sesarmid 
species, E. versicolor, N. smithii, P. bidens and P. eumolpe posses burrowing skills,   while 
P. bidens appeared to be the most active of the three sesarmids investigated.

Abstract     - Reasoning abilities of the learners and its development was well -discussed in the world of  
education.  The  higher  the  ability  of  the  person  to  reason  abstractly,  the  higher  the  probability  that  a 
person  will  effectively  function  in  the  society.  Thus,  it  is  the  main  goal  of  the  K  -12  Curriculum  of  the    
Department of Education to improve the reasoning abilities and        formal reasoning among students in 
the country. The higher the reasoning ability of a person, the more productive he is. The abili ty of logical   
reasoning has an essential function in the academic performance of students and their construction of the 
concepts.  This  study  aimed  to  determine  the  logical  reasoning  abilities  of  150  randomly  selected  junior 
high  school  students.  Specifical ly,  this  study  aimed  to  determine  the  logical  reasoning  abilities  namely  
combinatorial  reasoning,  controlling  variables,  correlation  reasoning,  probabilistic  reasoning  and 
proportional reasoning  among  the  grade 10  junior high  school  students  and  determine     whether  there  is a    
significant  difference  in  students’  logical  reasoning  abilities  according  to  their  gender.  The  respondents 
answered  the  Test  of  Logical  Thinking  (TOLT).  Thirty  respondents  were  interviewed  to  verify  their 
answers.  The  findings  of  the  stu   dy  led  to  the  following  conclusions:  most  students  correctly  answered  
problems  in  probabilistic  reasoning  and  least  number  of  students  correctly  answered  problems  in 
proportional  reasoning  and  combinatorial  reasoning  and,  male  and  female  respondents  have  e   qual    
performances  in  problems  pertaining  to  combinatorial  reasoning,  controlling  variables,  correlational 
reasoning  and  probabilistic  reasoning  but  female  respondents  are  better  in  proportional  reasoning  than 
the male respondents.

INTRODUCTION        
In  the  world  of  education,  reasoning  abilities  of    
the  learners  and  its  development  was  well -discussed.     
The  higher  the  ability  of  the  person  to  r   eason   
abstractly,  the  higher  the  chance  that  a  person  will 
effectively  function  in  the  society.  Thus,  it  is  the  goal 
of  the  Enhanced  Basic  Education  Curriculum  or  the 
K-12  Curriculum  of  the  Department  of  Education  to    
improve  the  reasoning  abilities  and  of     formal  
reasoning  among  students  at  all  levels  of  the  basic 
education  in  the  country.  The  higher  the  reasoning 
ability  of  a  person,  the  more  productive  he  is. 
According  to  Atay  [1]  and  Lawson  [2],  the  ability  of 
logical  reasoning  has  an  essential  function  i n  the  
academic  performance  of  students  and  their 
construction of concepts and knowledge.     
Demirel  [3],  Lawson  [4]  and  Linn  [5]  have    
distinguished  five  different  modes  of  formal 
operational  reasoning:  proportional  reasoning    -   
realizing  equal  proportions  of  t    wo  quantity  and  logic    
to  understand  and  solve  quantitative  relations ;   
controlling variables   - realize all the variables in given    
condition, suppose hypothesis for the role of variables 
and  systematically  control  variables  to  verify  the 
hypothesis  to  derive      conclusion;  probabilistic  
reasoning   - ratio  of  expected  probability  for  all  the   
possible probability    ; correctional reasoning    - ability to    
realize  relationship  between  variables  even  the 
changes  of  object  and  phenomena  are  irregular;     and    
combinatorial  reas oning   - count  all  the  possible  cases  
for solving problem without duplication  which are the  
determinants  of the success  of  students in science  and

Demirel  [3]  emphasized  that  logical  reasoning 
abilities  i    ncludes  effective  use  of  concepts,  giving  
scientific  solutions  to  problems,  detecting  differences 
between  concepts,  generalizing,  classifying, 
representing  a  problem  with  a  mathematical  formula, 
computing,  simulating  and  providing  a  hypothesis 
testing.  Mee   han  [7]  and  Shemesh  [8]  have  identified   
that  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  logical 
reasoning abilities between male and female.        
 
OBJECTIVES OF THE   STUDY       
With  the  introduction  of  the  Enhanced  Basic   
Education  Curriculum  in  the  Philippine  Basic 
Education  System  which  promotes  the  improvement 
of  logical  reasoning  abilities  among  Filipino  learners, 
this  study  generally  aimed  to   determine  the  logical     
reasoning  a    bilities  of  junior  high  school  students.   
Specifically,  this  study  aimed  to determine the logical 
reasoning  abilities  namely  proportional  reasoning, 
controlling  variables,  combinatorial  reasoning, 
probabilistic  reasoning  and  correlation  reasoning 
among  the  grade  10  junior  high  school  students  and  
determine  whether  there  is  a  significant  difference  in 
students’  logical  reasoning  abilities  according  to  their 
gender.     
    
M   ETHODS      
The  samples  of  this  study  were  150  grade  10     
students randomly selected from 10 public    junior high    
schools  in  the  Second  Congressional  District  of  the 
Province  of  Cotabato,  Philippines.  This  study  was 
conducted  from  October  2015  – February  2016.  The  
respondents  answered  the  Test  of  Logical  Thinking 
(TOLT).  Thirty  respondents  were  interviewe  d  to   
verify their answers.       
This  study  used  two  -stage  random  sampling.  The  
sample  schools  were  selected  through  simple  random 
sampling.  The  respondents  who  came  from  the 
randomly selected school and the respondents selected 
for  bottom -up  interview  were  sele  cted  using  simple     
random sampling.        
Before  questionnaires  were  administered,  formal     
permissions  from  the  Schools  Division 
Superintendents  of  the  Department  of  Education’s 
Schools  Divisions  of  Cotabato  Province  and  of 
Kidapawan  City  were  sought  and  obtained    .  The  
researcher himself administered the instrument used in 
this  study  including  the  bottom -up  interview.     
Respondents  (15  respondents  from  each  school)  were    
gathered  to  fill  -up  the  questionnaire.  The  students     
were  told  about  the  nature  of  the  instrument  a  nd  how     
this  should  be  answered.  They  were  given  an  enough 
time  (approximately  1  hours)  to  answer  the 
questionnaire.  After  the  testing,  30  respondents  (3 
respondents per school) were selected for a bottom  -up     
interview in verification of the answers.       
The ins trument used in this study was the “Test of     
Logical  Thinking  (TOLT)  developed  by  Tobin  and 
Capie  [9].  This  instrument  was  developed  to  measure 
the  modes  of  cognitive  reasoning  abilities  of  students 
according  to  Piaget:  proportional  reasoning, 
controlling  v  ariables,  probabilistic  reasoning,    
correlational  reasoning  and  combinatorial  reasoning. 
The  problems  were  distributed  into  the  following: 
problems  1  and  2  were  proportional  reasoning; 
problems  3  and  4  were  controlling  variable;  problems 
5  and  6  were  probab ilistic  reasoning;  problems  7  and   
8 were correlational reasoning; and problems 9 and 10 
were combinatorial reasoning.       
Descriptive  statistics  which  includes  measures  of  
variability  (standard  deviation)  and  measures  of 
central  tendency  (mean,)  were  used  to  determine   
logical  reasoning  abilities  of  junior  high  school 
students. The t -Test of independent samples and F  -test   
were used to test the hypothesis.

Majority  of  the  respondents  (61.50%)  answered  
the  problems  in  proportional  reasoning.  This  was 
followed  by  controlling  variable     reasoning  (45.00%)     
and  correlational  reasoning  (42.00%).  Least  number 
of  students  (26.50%)  answered  problems  in 
probabilistic reasoning and combinatorial reasoning.        
According  to  the  respondents  during  the    
interview,  most  of  the  students  said  that  they  got 
correct answers in problems pertaining to proportional 
reasoning  because  they  had  discussed  the  topics  in 
their  Mathematics  and  in  some  Sciences  subjects.

Meanwhile,  they  got  low  scores  in  problems  about 
combinatorial  reasoning  because  of  the  time 
constrai    nts  (maximum  of  1  hour).  They  had  the    
difficulty  in  answering  the  problems  in  combinatorial 
reasoning  because  there  was  no  other  technique  they 
knew other than the use of tree diagram.

There  was  no  significant  difference  between  the   
logical  reasoning  abilities  and  their  gender  with  the 
exemption  of  the  proportional  reasoning  where  in 
there  was  a  significant  difference  between  the 
proportional  reasoning  and  their  ge nder.   Male  and   
female  respondents  have  equal  performances  in 
problems  pertaining  to  controlling  variables, 
correlational  reasoning,  probabilistic  reasoning  and 
combinatorial reasoning.        
Female  respondents  are  better  in  proportional  
reasoning than the male     respondents. According to the   
female  respondents  during  the  bottom    -up  interview,     
they  were  able  to  answer  problems  pertaining  with 
proportional  reasoning  because  they  were  more 
exposed  in  daily  life  situations  like  budgeting  their 
weekly  allowance,  allocat ing  their  study  time  and    
doing  proportions  in  the  ingredients  of  the  menu  they 
cooked.     
CONCLUSION AND  RECOMMENDATION      
The  findings  of  the  study  led  to  the  following  
conclusions  in  the  logical  reasoning  abilities  of  grade 
10 junior high school students:     most students correctly     
answered  problems  in  probabilistic  reasoning  and   
least  number  of  students  correctly  answered  problems 
in proportional reasoning and combinatorial reasoning 
and  male  and  female  respondents  have  equal 
performances  in  problems  pertaini    ng  to  controlling     
variables,  correlational  reasoning,  probabilistic 
reasoning  and  combinatorial  reasoning  but  female 
respondents  are  better  in  proportional  reasoning  than 
the male respondents.       
In  view  of  the  results  and  in  consideration  of  the     
limitations     of  this  study,  the  following    
recommendations  are  hereby  presented:  teachers 
should  determine  the  logical  reasoning  abilities  of  the 
students  at  the  beginning  of  the  instruction  so  that 
proper  use  of  teaching  strategies,  instructional 
materials,  remediation  and  other  factors  needed  in  the   
delivery  of  the  lessons  be  used  properly  and 
appropriately;  it  is  also  recommended  that  teachers 
must expose students with higher order thinking skills 
mathematics  problems  so  that  their  reasoning  skills 
will  be  enhanced.  F  urther,  teachers  must  have  to  be   
creative  as  well  in  coming  with  relevant  tasks  to 
enhance  students’  logical  reasoning  abilities  and  a 
research  of  this  kind  with  different  logical  reasoning 
test  is  recommended;  curriculum  developers  must 
consider  the  level    s  of  cognitive  development  and  
logical  reasoning  abilities  of  students  in  making  new 
curriculum  and  in  reviewing  and  revising  the  existing 
one;  and  students  must  engage  to  activities  that  will 
enhance their logical reasoning abilities.

Abstract    – This  is  a  q    ualitative  study  which  described  the  existence  of  political  dynasties  in   
Cebu, Philippines.   The prevailing issues on political equality and perennial rule of political families were  
also  investigated  unfolding  the  Cebuanos    ’ perceptions  of  political  dynasty    and  its  impact  on  Cebuano  
bureaucracy.    The  method  of  data  analysis  used  in  the  study  was  narrative  inquiry  where  storytelling     
among  the  selected  key  informants  served  as  data  collection  technique.     Purposive  sampling  was  used  in  
the  selection  of  key  inform ant  politicians  while  random  sampling  for  key  informant  voters  was     
determined. The instruments used in data gathering were interviews and observations. The study revealed 
the true meaning of political dynasty, its advantages and drawbacks to its constituen   ts. Varied rejoinders   
and call for democracy motivated the selected key informant politicians to continue serving the citizenry.  
This  study  recommends  that  an  anti -individualistic  voting  preferences  campaign  be  promoted  by  the  
government, education and yo    uth sectors in transforming intelligent Filipino voters.

INTRODUCTION        
Democracy    as  shared  by  Sanders  is  commonly  
assoc   iated  with  political  equality  and  majority  rule   
[1].     The  ideology,  in  its  nature  and  purpose,  is  to     
invoke  freedom  and  political  equality.  The  right  to 
public  service  and  political  affiliations  regardless  of 
race,  gender  and  religion  is  observed  in  most 
de  mocratic  societies.  However,  most  of  them  are     
embracing    the trend of dynastical governance.        
Political  dynasty  commonly  refers  to  a  family  in     
which  several  members  by  blood  or  marriage  often  in 
several  generations  or  multiple  si  blings  are  involved   
in  electo  ral  politics.  According  to  Dal  Bo‟,  E  and  P.,   
& Synder, political dynasty  is evident in every country    
where   inequality  is sometimes observed   in the practice     
of  political  power     [2]    .  The  situation  challenges  the  
significance  and  existence  of  political  equali ty.     
Moreover,  it  is  an  example  of  irony  living  in 
democracy.  This  paper  sought  to  analyze    the  reasons    
why  in  a  certain  point  of  democratic  principle,  people 
choose to accept    political   dominance.      
The  study  of  Kenawas  on  political  dynasties  in   
Indonesia  reve aled  that  the  occurrence  of  regional   
political  families  in  the  country  is  brought  by  three 
factors,  namely;  weak  party  institutionalization, 
deficient  electoral  law  implementation  and  a 
“personalistic”  mind   -set  among  the  voters  during    
elections  [3].  As  fou    nd  out  in  Indonesian  political  
system,  political  dynasties  are  partly  caused  by  the 
voters‟  attitude  during  elections.    This  becomes  
necessary  to  understand  why  people  choose  to 
patronize  political  clans.  By  this,  a  picture  about  the 
underlying  sources  of  t  he  existence  of  political    
dynasties would be developed.       
Moreover, Dal Bó, E and P. and Snyder reiterated    
the  saying,  “power  begets  power”  and  asserted  that 
when  a  person  holds  dominance  in  power,   there  is  an   
assumption  that this person will   be observing    political   
dynasty [2]. This implies that dynastical governance is 
a  consequence  of  one‟s  dominance  in  position  and 
authority in the government.        
One  of  the  democratic  countries  that  have  been   
ruled  by  political  dynasties  is  the  Philippines.  East 
Asia  Forum     included  in  its  issue  the  present  plight  of  
both  Indonesia  and  Philippines  as  the  biggest 
democracies  in  South  East  Asia  facing  the  threat  of

political family domination  [4]    . A particular revelation   
indicated  that  seventy  percent  (70%)  of  the  members 
of  th  e  Philippine  Congress  came  from  political  
dynasties.      
During  the  American   regime,  political  dynasties   
were  practiced     in  Philippine  politics.    For  Trajano    &  
Kenawas,  dynastic  politicians  are  returning  to  the 
campaign  trail  to  safeguard  turf  or  to  recapture  ol d   
positions  in  the  upcoming  polls     [4].  The  Philippines,     
being  an  archipelago  with  82  provinces,  has  one  or 
more  ruling  dynasties.  To  enumerate  some,  the 
Marcoses  are  prevailing  in  Ilocos    Norte,  Arroyos  in    
Pampanga,  Cojuangcos  in Tarlac,  Ejercito -Estradas i n   
Manila, and others.         
One  of  the  country‟s  islands  which  are  also  
dominated by political families is the popular province 
of  Cebu.  Since  the  dawn  of  Cebuano  democracy,  the 
province  has  been  associated  with  the  names  of 
Osmeña, Rama and Garcia. The birth o    f political elites  
has continued until now which sustained the patronage 
of  political    dynasties  in  the  government.    Further,    
Myrina  revealed  that  fifty  five  (55)    political  families    
based  on  the  2013  election  have  continued  to  rule 
without  interruptions   [5]. One  of  those  which  placed     
ninth  (9th)  in  the  ranking  is  the  Durano  family 
reigning  for  31  years  in  Cebu‟s  fifth  district.  This 
implies  that  Cebuanos,  either  city  or  province    -wide,  
are  espousing   political  dynasties.   By  conducting  a  
study  about  Cebuano  dyna stical  governance  and  as  a  
pioneering  place  for  political  dynasties,  the 
researchers  would  understand  why  voters  chose  to 
patronize  elites  in  politics.  The  reasons  for  the 
patronage  of  political  families  would  be  a  significant 
instrument  in  identifying  how     a  political  dynasty  
emerges.        
On  the  contrary,  the  1987  Constitution  of  the    
Philippines  states  in  its  Article  II  Section  26  that    'the    
State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for 
public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may 
be  defined  by  law.'  This  gives  the  legislators  of  the  
country  the  basis  to  propose  an  anti  -political  dynasty     
law.  Senator  M    iriam  Defensor  Santiago  proposed     
Senate  Bill  No.  2649  or  the  Anti  -Political  Dynasty     
Bill  joint  with  the  House  Bill  No.  3413  of  Rep. 
Teodoro  Casi   ño.  Both  are  currently  in  pending  status  
subject  for  discussion  and  debate.  The  failure  of  the 
Constitution,    rests  mainly  o   n  its  insufficiency   .  Lores    
posited  that  while  the  Constitution  acknowledges  the 
problem, it leaves the solution to Congress     [6].    
The  word  “political  dynasty”  is  not  specifically  
defined  by  the  constitution.  Politicians,  as  logical  as 
they  are,  can  form  diverse  perceptions  about  the 
limitations  provided  by  democratic  principles. 
However,     Santiago  highlighted  in  her  explanatory    
note  in  t he  proposed  bill  that  the   domination  of  
political  power  and   the  utilization  of    public  resources   
by  such  families  affect  the     nation‟s    citizenry    [7].  The  
bill  is  not  just  to  address  the  collapse  of  political 
equality  but  also  as  a  socio   -economic  concern.  Thi    s   
study  sought  to  recognize  the  effects  of  political 
family  dominance  to  the  citizens.  The  necessity  to 
identify  its  effects  is  helpful  to  settle  the  background 
of  the  bill  because  this  would  affect  the  whole 
citizenry and not just the Cebuanos.        
The  effec  ts  of  political  dynasties  in  the   
Philippines  are  already  been  underscored  by  Tusalem 
and  Pe -Aguirre    by   examining  the  country‟s  House  of   
Representatives  [8]. It is found out    that such provinces    
with  dominant  political   families    are     more  or  less  
capable  of  be ing  good  leaders  specifically    in areas    
such  as    infrastructure  development s,  health  
expenditure ,   criminality  issues ,  employment,  and     
other   government   services   .  This  conveys  that  the     
effects  of  political  dynasties  on  democratic 
governance  are  generally  detri   mental  in  terms  of  the  
distribution  of  public  goods  and  services  .  These        
effects  call  the  necessity  to  understand  how  citizens 
live  under  the  rule  of  political  clans  and  to  describe 
how  evident  the  effects  of  political  dynasty  to 
democratic  g   overnance  are  i   n  Cebuano  economy .   
Correspondingly,  it  is  supported  then  that  political 
dynasties    have  dominant  control  over  both  forcible  
and  economic  resources  within  given  territorial 
jurisdictions.  These  unequal  distributions  of  public 
goods  and  services  increase  econ    omic  gaps  between     
citizens which inclines poverty.        
Querubin     studied     how  term  limits  introduced  in  
the  1987  Philippine  Constitution  destabilize  dynastic 
patterns  in  the  government.  The  study  revealed  that 
the  persistence  of  elites  in  the  society  undermines   the    
effects of such political reform saying that term limits 
has  no  “statistically  significant  impact”  on  restricting 
families‟  persistence  for  power   [9].  Thus,  it  suggests  
that  political  reforms  should  modify  the  fundamental 
sources  of  dynastic  power  to    effectively  shape  a   
political  balance.  Such  results  foster  importance  to 
analysing the roots of political dynasties. Recognizing 
the  underlying  sources  of  dynastic  powers  of  the 
dominating  political  families  is  needed  for  the

alteration  of  politics  in  a  so ciety.  Thus,  the  causes  of  
their  emergence  will  significantly  add  schemes  on 
improving political systems.        
Further,  the  research  conducted  by  E.  Dal  Bó,  P.    
Dal  Bó,  and  Snyder    emphasizing    that  “power  begets    
power”  also  depicts  the  significance  of  tracing  the      
dynastic  patterns  present in  Cebuano  government  [2].   
Power,  as  a  self -expanding  element  in  politics,  really  
has a great impact on every civilization    . The Cebuano   
society  then,  as  a  great  bailiwick  of  politicians,  is  a 
concrete  sample  for  understanding  pat   terns  in  gaining  
political dominance.        
Mendoza,  Beja,  Venida     &Yap    identified  poverty     
as  the  source  that  entrenches  political  dynasties  in  the    
Philippines     [10 ]. This suggests that political inequality  
is an effect of poverty. If poverty causes the existence        
and  persistence  of  political  dynasties,  it  could  be  then 
that  people  includes  personal  indulgences  as  basis  in 
choosing their leaders.     
On  the  other  hand,  the  first  paper  to  exploit   
findings  that  tenure  length  has  no  significance  to  the 
persistence  of  poli   tical  families  is  the  formative  study  
of  Van  Coppenolle     on  political  dynasties  in    
democratic  countries    [11    ].  The  author  highlighted  the   
direct  impact  of  the  dynastic  status  of  electoral 
candidates  to  the  continuity  of  political  families.  In 
terms  of  voter‟   s  preference,  dynastic  candidates  are   
more  likely  to  benefit  from  their  surnames  bearing 
credibility  for  quality  governance.  This  can  be 
associated  with  the  self -expanding  nature  of  authority   
in  which  dynastic  status  itself,  is  primarily  beneficial 
to  dyna    stic  politicians.  However,  it  provides  conflict    
to  the  findings  of  E.  Dal  Bó,  P.  Dal  Bó,  and  Snyder 
that  the  longer  the  tenure,  the  greater  chance  of 
politicians  to  establish  a  political  clan   [2].  It  is  but  
critical  to  a  comparative  analysis  about  the  endu    rance   
of  existing  political  families.  It  could  either  be 
supplied  by  the  voters‟  attitude  or  by  the  dynastic 
attributes of political dynasties.      
Cranston  emphasized  the  significance  of     
popularity  or  name  recognition  to  the  persistence  of 
political  clans     [12    ].  He  had  explained  that  in  USA  or   
in  most  democracies,  voters  are  more  likely  to  be  fed 
up  by  political  advertis ements  and     propaganda   during     
elections.  As  a  result,  they  forget  to  recognize  some 
potential  candidates  in  the  poll.  Voters  then,  are  more 
like    ly to vote only the names that are familiar to them.    
Most  of  these  commonly  recognized  names  came 
from  existing  political  families.  Such  political 
behavio ur  of  voters  really  adds  longevity  to  the    
existence  of  political  dynasties.  Similar  to  Cebu, 
dynastica   l  governance  may  appear  as  a  result  of  such     
case. Cebuano attitudes during elections are important 
to analy    ze in identifying dynastic patterns in Cebuano  
politics.       
Political dynasties as shared by    Bershidsky   are not    
that  always    negative  in  nature     [13    ].  He  even    cited  the  
paper  of   Mendoza,    Beja,  Venida   & Yap    stating  that  
political  dynasties    are  engaged  in  long  -term  planning     
and  implementation  of  government  projects  as 
compared  with  p   oliticians with  shorter    terms  of office    
[10 ]. This  expresses  that  political  f  amilies  while  
expanding  their  powers  manage  to  take  care  of  their 
constituents  as  well.  The  projects  implemented  by  the 
members  of  ruling  clans  are  given  sustainability 
through the rule of one political family. This could be 
a  reason  why  citizens  in  Cebu  c   hoose  to  patronize    
political families.     
In  relevance  to  historical  facts,  Cabigao  
underlined  historical  roots  of  political  dynasties 
emerging  in  Filipino  communities  [14    ]. The  author  
epitomized  political  dynasty  as  a  modern  monarchy 
and  aristocracy.  Since  p re-colonial  rule,  Filipinos   
were  been  ruled  by  a  monarch  called  “Datu”  who 
possesses  all  authorities  in  the  government. 
Successors  c   ame  from  only  one  family.  During  the  
Spanish  era,  dominance  in  power  and  wealth  is 
already  prevalent.  A  town  aristocracy  cal  led     
“principalia”  is  composed  of  wealthy  land  owners. 
The members of these families often ha  d the privilege     
to  acquire  positions  in  the  government  and  the 
peasants  working  for  their  lands    we  re  expected  to    
patronize  them.  These  facts  challenge  the  principle    of     
political  equality  existing  in  a  democratic  society.  If 
political  dynasty  is  an  incarnation  of  such  political    
system,  then  democracy  is  not  really  valued  by  the 
majority.  It  gives  the  idea  that  democracy,  people 
believe  to  be  well  established  today,  is   just  a  mask  of  
what is called reality.     
With  the  proposed  bills  prohibiting     the     
establishment  of  political  dynasties,  it is  significant to 
know  the  behaviour  and  ideas  of  the  target  political 
families  towards  the  raised  concern.  The  case  of 
Cebuano  dynasti    cal  governance  exemplifies  the   
countrywide  issue.  Political  dynasties  in  Cebu  had 
dwelled  for  decades  and  the  sustaining  forces  came 
from the people.  With this scenario, democracy is still 
undeniably prevalent in the political behaviours of the 
Cebuanos.    Thus  people  need  to  know  whether

political  dynasty  is  a  choice  or  the  state  of  having  no 
choice.         
Moreover,  this  study  aimed  to  build  a  concrete   
illustration  of  the  Cebuanos‟  political  behaviours  by 
which the persistence of political clans is indulged. As 
this  study  documents  historic    al and  psychological   
patterns  in  the  evolution  of  political  families,  getting 
the  perceptions  of  the  members  of  the  political 
families could strengthen the validity of such patterns. 
Further, the views of political elites about     the issue of   
political  dynasty  may  not  just  appear  as  a  piece  of 
defense  or  argument  but  also  a  providing  idea  about 
the source of their tenacity.       
 
OBJECTIVES OF THE   STUDY       
This  study  sought  to  analyze  the  existence  of    
political  dynasties  in  Cebu.  With  t    he  issues  
concerning  political  equality  and  perennial  rule  of 
political families, this study looked into the Cebuanos ‟   
perceptions  of  political  dynasty  and  described  the 
underlying  sources  of  the  dynastic  powers  existing  in 
Cebuano  society.  Further,  the  co    ntributions  of     
political  dynasties  to  Cebuano  citizenry  as  well  as 
their    reactions  and  insights  of  Cebuano  political   
families  on  political  dynasty  were  unveiled  in  the 
study.      
    
M   ATERIALS AND    M   ETHODS      
This  is  a  qualitative  research  which  utilized     
narrative  i    nquiry      as  method  of  data  analysis.     
Informants  are engaged     in  narrating their     stor    ies while   
being   interview   ed  . For Bell, narrative inquiry involves  
meaning  making  during  data  collection,  interpretation 
and writing of the findings     [15 ].      
Purposive  sampling  w  as  used  in  identifying  the  
key  informant  politicians  while  random  sampling  for 
key informant    voters  was determined. There were two     
key  informant‟  politicians  who  were  members  of 
political  dynasty  families    .   Both  were   prominent  
politicians  that  came  and  been   rooting  political  clans  
in  Cebu    .  Criteria  include  the  number  of  relatives  or    
family members presently positioned in public office.       
There  were  also    five  key  informant    voters  per    
bailiwick    who    participated  in     the  study.     They  were     
selected  for  being  a  resid  ent  and  a  registered  voter  of  
the  territorial  jurisdictions  housed  by  the  chosen 
politician  informants.  The  number  of  key  informants   
determined  for  every  jurisdiction  was  based  on  the   
number  of  voters  in  the  certain  bailiwick  and  the 
availability of resear  chers for deliberate interviews.        
Interviews and observations served as    instruments    
for  data  gathering.  For  the  identified  politicians,  a 
letter  was  sent  to  secure  an  interview  schedule 
convenient to them. For the voter key informants, they 
were  interview ed  and  observed  based  on  researchers‟  
accessibility and convenience.      
RESULTS AND     DISCUSSION      
Unveiling the Sources of Existing Dynastic Powers       
 
A.   Perceptions on Political Dynasty       
Political  dynasty  as  defined  by  many  is  a  family    
wherein  most  members  either  by  blood  or  marriage     
are  involved  in  politics  or  in  acquisition  of 
government  position.  But  in  the  Senate  Bill  2649 
introduced  by  Sen.    Santiago,  political  dynasty  is   
practiced by a family of an incumbent elective official 
and powers are distributed in differe   nt positions in the     
government [    16  ]. This portrayal    affects the perception     
of  citizens  and  politicians  about  the  issue.  Regardless 
of  this,  it  is  still  important  to  know  how  citizens  and 
political  elites  understand  and  instil  the  word  in  their 
minds.  When    asked  to  describe  political  dynasty,  the   
key informants revealed:        
    
Political  dynasty  is  continuity  of  good  projects. 
(KI -1). 
        
Political dynasty is a sharing of cooperation in the 
government. (KI -4).    
    
These  utterances  indicate  that  political  dynasty  is   
project  continuation  and  completion.  It  is  a  common 
scenario in any Cebuano locality. Projects initiated by 
politician  A  should  be  continued  by  politician  B.  In 
terms  also  of  bureaucracy,  projects  proposed  by 
politician  A  should  be  approved  by  politician  B. 
Among  the  key  informants,  most  said  that  the 
members  of  a  political  family  usually  have 
cooperation  and  unity  in  their  decisions.  However, 
there  are  instances  that  these  projects  died  like  a 
natural  death.  Meaning,  if  politician  A  is  not  a  party 
mate  of  po    litician  B,  the  initiated  project  of  politician   
A  will  just  be  a  waste.    Given  the  situation  in 
Philippine politics, most politicians when put in office 
try to establish a name or something that would really 
be  credited  to  them  or  when  the  preceding  offici    al  is  
from  a  different  party,  the  programs  started  by  the

incumbent  are  less  to  be  continued.  This  condition 
indicates  a     source  of  dynastic  powers.  People  would   
prefer  candidates  who  can  continue  the  projects  that 
would  benefit  them.  The  formative  paper  of     Ronald     
Mendoza     and  his  colleagues    which  underlined  the  
sustainability  of  projects  implemented  by  ruling  clans 
validates  this  result  [10    ].  It  is  an  undeniable  fact  that  
political  dynasties  are  beneficial  when  implementing 
programs    having  long    -term goals.        
On the contrary, the same key informants commented:     
    
Political  dynasty  is  denying  other  people  from 
aspiring to become public servant   s. (KIP -1)     
    
Such    utterance    describes  political  dynasty  as  
detrimental  to  political  equality.   Despite  the  fact  that    
politica    l  dynasty  provides  sustainability  of  projects,  it     
is  also  symptomatic  that  it  has  negative  effect  to  the 
development of active citizenship.      
    
B.   Contributions of Political Dynasties       
Loyalty  of  the  people  is  considered  the  strongest    
arm that holds a political  family.     This loyalty is drawn   
from  the  legacies  and  contributions  of  a  certain 
political  family.  When  asked  about  how  they  benefit 
from political dynasties, the key informants said:      
    
He’s  very  easy  to  approach  whatever  our 
problems are given that we are po   or. He helped   
me  find    a  job.  He     extended  his  financial    
assistance  with  my  family  when  someone  is     
admitted  to  the  hospital.  Even  my  neigh   bors    
share the same sentiments.  He is really    good in     
governance.  He  is  rea    lly  different.  I  owe  him  a     
lot. (KI    -3)     
 
Of  cou rse,  I  benefited.     My  child  was  given  a    
scholarship, a big help to us (KI   -5).        
    
Like  for  example,  the  transportation  from  this 
island  to  the  adjacent  ones  and  vice  versa  was 
initiated by the political family .They  facilitated        
the  construction  of  sea  port  fro   m  here  going  to  
the  next island. It is  better to  take  a  barge than 
a small     boat    especially when if there is weather     
disturbance (KI -2).        
 
My  husband  and  other     physically  disabled        
persons  were  given  an  opportunity  to  get  
involved  in    livelihood  programs    where    the    
demand for their skills is needed (KI   -1).        
    
These  revelations  uncover  the  fact  that  people    
choose  leaders     based  o    n  the  benefits  they  receive .   
Most  of  the  financial  support,  as  uttered  by  the  key 
informants,  is  a  personal  benefit  the  key  informants 
recei   ved  for  patronizing  political  dynasties.     A  person  
is  able  to  establish  a  political  dynasty  if  he/she  had 
nailed  a  certain  loyalty.     These  benefits  can  be   
described  as    indulgences  that  affect  the  citizens‟  
voting  behaviours.     The  only  but  great  effect  revea    led     
by  these  responses     is  referred  to  as  the  decline  of     
intelligent voting  . Four of the five key informants    said       
that  they  really  have  something  to  owe  to  their 
leaders. Most of them said that they are really     assisted        
in  terms  of  financial    aspect  and  job  as    sistance.   It  is  
then    consider    ed  as   moral  obligations  in  choosing   
electoral  candidates.  Such  behavior  doesn‟t  indicate 
wise  voting.  This  suppo  rts  the  study  of  Kenawas    
which  claimed  that  one  of  the  factors  that  bring  the 
occurrence  of  political  families  is  t  he  “personalistic”     
mind     set  of  voters  during  elections  [3].    Every  voter   
has     his/her     personal  considerations  during  elections     
and  the  greatest  gravity  that  pulls    the  scenario  is   their   
indulgences.  Loyalty  to  a  person  is    unbreakable     and     
so,  intelligent  votin g  declines.  However,  this  voting    
behavior  is  originally  an  effect  and  not  a  cause. 
Having  underscored  historical  roots  of  polit   ical    
dynasties  of  Cabigao  , it  is    really  an  assert  ion  that   
political  dynasty  existed  first  for  it  ruled  even  before 
the birth of d  emocracy     [11].      
The  study  of  Mendoza,  Beja,  Venida  and  Yap       
which  unfolded  poverty  as  one  of  the  causes  of  the 
existence of political dynasties in the country supports 
these findings   [10    ]. The poverty prevalent in Cebuano     
societies  really  affects  the  mind   set  of  citizens  when     
choosing  electoral  candidates.  They  become 
individualistic  because  of  the  personal  indulgences 
they  had  acquired. They  prefer  people  who  have  been 
helping  them  through  specified  programs  which  had 
sourced  the  persistence  of  political  f amilies.    The     
research  highlights  of    Van  Coppenolle  about  the     
dynastic  status  of  electoral  candidates  that  directly 
contributes     to  their  persistence  also  validates  this   
result   [12]. It  stated  that  surnames  from  political  
dynasties  mostly  bear  credibility  fo    r  quality  
governance,  the  reason  why  they  are  preferred  during 
elections.  Such  credibility  comes  from  their 
implemented  programs  and  policies  that  leave

indulgences  to  citizens.   However,  this  result  argues     
that the findings of Tusalem and Pe -Aguirre about  the     
detrimental  effects  of  political  dynasties  to  the 
governance   is  not  applicable  to  Cebuano  society  [   13  ].  
Cebuanos, as unveiled by their responses, are recipient 
of quality governance brought by political families.        
    
C.   Submissive Voters      
Political  dynasty  i   s  often  associated  with  
dominance in politics   . Consequently, c   itizens  ruled by   
political  clans  often  become  submissive  during 
elections.  When  asked  if  they  want  to  continue  the 
persistence  of  political  dynasties,  these  were  their 
revelations:        
 
For me, it w    ould be really fine as long as they     
can bring   progress and    development  (KI    -1).        
 
If  they     do  well  in  their  policies,  then  why  
bother changing them?(KI    -2.     
 
I  will  continue  with  their  leadership  because     
there’s no other choice. (KI    -3, 4 & 5).     
 
These  verbatim  a  ccounts  suggest  two   
characteristic  of  democracy.  First,  democracy  would 
only  be  the  freedom  to  choose  if  only  there  are 
choices and second, it is the capacity to evade change. 
Having  these  responses,  it  is  implied  that  the 
persistence of political dynastie   s is caused by citizens‟    
submissiveness.  The  courage  to  accept  change  and  to 
challenge  the  existing  rulers  is  necessary  for 
development.  As  revealed  in  the  study  of  Querubin 
that  term  limits  has  no  statistically  significant  impact 
in  restricting  political  families‟  persistence  for  power,     
it  can  be  asserted  that  the  expansion  of  dynastic 
powers  can  only  be  minimized  or  stopped  by  taking 
the  courage  to  run  or  aspire  for  public  service  [  14  ].  
Political  dynasties  then  really  exist  because  of  the 
absence  of  coura  geous  citizens  to  challenge  the     
leadership of existing dynasties.       
    
Behaviors  and  Ideas  in  Response  to  the  Issue  o  n   
Political Dynasty       
    
The  behaviors  and  ideas  of  the  members  of  the   
political  family  in  response  to  the  issue  of  political 
dynasties are cluste    red into the following themes:      
 
a. Varied Rejoinders        
 
Politicians  showed  varied  reactions  regarding  the  
issue  of  political  dynasty.  When  asked  whether  they 
are  in  favo   ur  of  the  anti   -political  dynasty     bill    or  not ,   
the key informants‟ shared:     
    
Yes, I’m in     favou   r of it (KIP    -1).    
    
I  am  against  the  bill  per  se.  In  a  small 
community,  there  are  many  relatives     who  are    
just  as  talented,  just  as  dedicated  and  will  be 
restricted  just  because  they  happen  to  have  the 
same family names    (KIP   -2).    
    
These  responses     submit  the  id    ea  that  not  all  
members  of  political  families  agree  to  the  persistence 
of  dynastical  governance.  If     KI  -1 is  not  in  favo    ur  of  
dynastical governance, it could really be then asserted 
that  political  dynasties  were  not  just  brought  by    
dominance  but  also  by  dem   ocracy  .  The  response  of    
KI  -2 shares  a  different  principle.     He/she  emphasizes  
political equality regardless of surname.     If a person   
is  deprived  of  the  right  to  run  just  because  of  his/her 
surname, then equality appears to be biased. This now 
gives  a  differ    ent  argument    that    the  presence  of  
political  dynasty  is  not  an  indicator  in  the  absence    
of political equality.      
    
b. Call of Democracy        
    
People  represent  democracy,  a  government  where     
all authority emanates from them. This theme refers to 
the principle of politic    al families that their persistence  
was  gained  through  democracy.  They  persisted 
beca    use  of  the  people‟s  demand.  One  key  informant    
said:       
    
When  you  run  for  a  public  office,  you  owe  the 
people  for  your  mandate  and  you  have  leaders 
in  every  barangay,  every  tow    n,  and  every  city.   
There  are  a  lot  of  people  whom  you  should 
consider when deciding to stop because most of 
them really  want  you  to  continue  and  that  from 
the  very  beginning;  I  have  endeavoured  to 
establish  a  leadership  for  service,  not  for 
power   . (KI   -1)     
    
This     relays  an  idea  that  their  continuous  service  is     
mandated  by  people‟s  call.  On  the  other    hand,  the     
second key informant disclosed:

The  good  old  man  (the  pioneering  politician 
ancestor)    had  a  very  good  heart.  He  had  a     
program  from  birth  to  grave,  He  ha    d  a  vision        
and he was able to build an empire. (KI -2).        
    
It  was  said  that  the  pioneering  leader  of  their     
political family was able to build an empire because of 
having  a  good  heart  and  a  vision.    This  just  implies 
that people, when led well by a powerful pe rson, starts    
to  have  a  patronization.  Such  behavior  is  caused  by 
their freedom to choose driven by democracy.        
CONCLUSION AND  RECOMMENDATION      
The existence and persistence of political dynasties    
can  mainly  be  attributed  to  the  eccentricity  of citizens 
in  re  sponse  to  their  political  responsibilities.  The    
sources  of  existing  dynastic  powers  unveiled  in  this 
study  namely  advantages  of  political  dynasties,  its 
contributions  to  citizens  and  submissiveness  of  voters 
were  largely  caused  by  individualistic  mind  set   of  
voters  with  regard  to  their  political  responsibilities. 
The  voting  preference  of  individuals  was  drawn  from 
the  things  they  think  that  would  benefit  them.  The 
variation  of  the  behaviors  in  response  to  the  issue  of 
political  dynasty  coming  from  the  membe    rs  of  
political  families  is  also  indicative  to  eccentricity.  It 
implies  that  politicians,  same  with  citizens,  share 
individuality  in  behaviors  responding  to  political 
issues.     
This study  recommends  that the    different sectors of    
the  society,  namely;  the     gove    rnment,  the  education     
and  youth  should  develop  an     anti    -individualistic    
voting  preferences  campaign  during  elections.  This  is 
not  mainly  to  stop  political  dynasty  but  rather,  a 
mechanism  in  promoting  intelligent  voting.   All    
citizens  should  not  only  consider    things  that  would    
benefit  themselves  when  voting  but  also  things  that 
would benefit the whole nation.         
Quantitative  evidences  of  poverty  level  in  some   
towns  and  provinces  controlled  by  political  dynasties 
are  highly  suggested  as  subject  for  further 
invest  igations.    Such  investigations  would  further   
validate  how  political  dynasty  greatly  affects  the 
poverty status of the masses, a detrimental problem in 
the country.

Introduction        
The  Philippine  archipelago  has  a  total  land  area  of  30M  ha  and  its  economy  is  rooted  in  agriculture.  The  
rising demand of land for food production had taken in the last century, from a sparsely 28 cap km  -2 in 1910  
to  a  densely  populated  of  273 cap  km  -2 in  2003  (  Kastner and Nonhebel,  2009 ) and  the country’s  population    
density  had  increased  by  20.7%  from  2010  -2012  (    NSO,  2012  ).  The  promotion  of  agriculture  and  timber    
industry  in  the  past  had  paved  the  way  for  migrants  to  cultivate  the  soil  in  Bukidnon  ( Lao,  1992  ).  In recent   
decades,  the  stabilization  of  the  lowlands  intensification  and  the  fa  ilure  of  industrialization  to  absorb  labor     
surplus  has  led  to  a  major  migration  of  subsistence  farmers  into  the  marginal  uplands  (   Cramb,  2005    ).  
Farmers  plant  crops  continuously  and  apply  fertilizers  without  assessing  the  current  soil  fertility.

Application  rates depend on how much resources the farmers have and therefore under or over application    
of  these  inputs  can  happen.  Reports  revealed  that  most  of  Mindanao  soils  are  of  volcanic  origin,  however, 
studies on physico  -chemical and mineralogical properties,  genesis and classifications were scarce (  Bacatio et  
al., 2005   ). Although data on crop production are available, the relationships between soil characteristics and   
plant response including its nutrient assimilation are not studied.         
It  is  imperative  for  la nd  users  to  know  the  capacity  of  the  soil  that  supports  intensive  agriculture.  A  soil     
reference  system  (SRS)  guides  decision  making  towards  an  agro   -environmentally  sound  soil  management.  
The  SRS  is  an  important  component  of  a  Land  Information  System  (LandI    S)  which  facilitates  objective  and  
scientifically  based  land  use  decisions.  A  LandIS  is  the  pooling  of  information  which  is  prerequisite  to  land 
resource  surveys  for  physical  land  appraisal  which  can  be  used  for  land  suitability  evaluation  (  FAO,  1989  ).  
To  deliver precise soil information to crop plot users, one has to go down to plot level in gathering data.  The   
SRS  is  the  integration  of  field  and  laboratory  data,  crop  yields  and  plant  response  assessment  as  tool  to 
assess and monitor soil fertility.      
This     study is a component of the development of a generic protocol for a LandIS for land use planning in the    
highlands  of  Mindanao  Philippines  which  adopted  the  framework  and  methodology  in  Bock  (1994)    .  The  
objective  of  this  study  was  to  build  an  SRS  for  soil  fertility  assessment  and  monitoring  and  specifically   
sought to: (1) determine the basic nutrients for topsoil fertility assessment and monitoring of representative 
plots  in  two  locations  by  topsoil  composite  samples  analyses,  (2)  find  out  the  crop  yields  i n  plots  where     
topsoil  composite  samples  were  taken,  and  (3)  verify  the  association  of  topsoil  analyses  results  with  crop 
yields.     
Material and Method s   
Study Area Description      
This  study  was  carried  out  in  Miarayon,  Talakag,  Bukidnon  in  the  island  of  Mindanao    ,  the  Philippines.    
Miarayon  is  situated  at  the  foot  of  the  northwest  side  of  Mt.  Kalatungan.  Mt.  Kalatungan  is  a  Quaternary 
volcano which  is  mostly basaltic  and  pyroclastic  in  character and  analyses of  its  rock samples  revealed  that 
these are calc  -alkaline    dacite, calc   -alkaline basalt and shoshonitic basaltic andesite (    Sajona et al., 1997 ). The  
piedmont  is  dissected  with  permanent  streams  and  watercourses.  Preliminary  investigation  had  identified 
the  relationships  between  rock,  soil,  relief  and  land  use  alo  ng  the  longitudinal  toposequence  excepting  the     
summit  under  forest.  The  long  volcanic  footslope  was  divided  according  to  relief  and  elevation  into  upper 
part (1,900 to 1,600 m asl), the intermediate part (1,600 to 1,400 m asl) and the lower part (1,400 to  1,300   
m asl).         
The  center  of  Miarayon  where  the  community  is  concentrated  is  located  at  an  elevation  of  approximately 
1,450  m  asl  at  5  to  10%  slope.  The  permanent  fields  have  thick  brownish  black  (10YR2/2  to  2/3)  topsoil. 
Dominant  crops  grown  are  potatoes    (Solanum  tuberosum    Linn    .), carrots  (  Daucus  carota  var.  sativus   )  and  
corn  ( Zea  mays   Linn.).  Potatoes  and  carrots  are  cash  crops  and  corn  is  for  household  consumption.  The     
initial groundwork had identified nine pedon locations. However, in this study, the s   urrounding plots around     
four  pedon  locations,  P  4 and  P    5 of  the  intermediate  part  (Salsalan)  and  P   7 and  P    8 in  the  lower  part  
(Mambuaw)  were  taken  into  consideration  because  these  are  the  locations  where  Miarayon  production 
areas  are  concentrated.  Mambuaw  is   the  site  of  the  old  Miarayon  settlement  in  which  according  to  farmers   
had been intensively cultivated since earlier than 1950s. Salsalan is the later hamlet location where the plots 
are  cultivated  recently.  It  can  be  seen  that  newly  opened  production  plot    s  are  advancing  towards  the     
upslope.        
The  thirty -year  mean  annual  rainfall  recorded  at  Malaybalay  Weather  Station,  Bukidnon  is  2,569  mm  with   
wettest  months  from  July  to  October  (PAGASA   -DOST,  2014).  Mean  annual  temperature  and  relative    
humidity recorded at <  500 m asl are 27°C and 74% respectively (   CMU, 2012   ).  Areas with elevations >500 m    
asl have 18 -20 °C and relative humidity of ~80%. The areas around the volcanic slopes have semi    -temperate  
conditions which can support broad range of highland crops.         
Field   Investigation and Soil Sampling     
Defined  pedons  were  described  according  to     Delecour  and  Kindermans  (1977)   .  Soil  horizon  samples  were     
taken for subsequent soil analyses. Undisturbed soil horizons were also taken from each position to measure 
bulk  densities     and  water  retention  capacities.  A  total  of  24  representative  crop  plots  were  selected  for

topsoil  composite  sampling  and  yield  measurements.  Twelve  plots  were  situated  around  P   4 and  P    5 and  the  
other  12  around  P    7 and  P    8.  Each  studied  location  had  four  plots    that  were  planted  with  potatoes,  four  with   
carrots  and  four  with  corn  were  investigated.  Composite  topsoil  samples  of  20  cm  depth  were  taken  from 
each plot.      
Laboratory Analysis     
Soil  horizon  samples  were  analyzed  to  determine  the  soil  classification.  Param    eters  were  soil  pH  (H   2O  and     
1N  KCl),  exchangeable  acidity  and  Aluminum  (Al) by  Yuan  Method and  atomic  absorption measurement for 
Al,  TOC  (adapted  Springer  Klee  Method),  allophanes  ( Fieldes  and  Perrot,  1966 ),  Cation  exchange  capacity  
(CEC) and cations (Mets on Method with 1 N ammonium acetate at pH7), and total P (tri   -acid mineralization).  
Complementary  analyses  for  sesquioxides  were  conducted  to  check  the  criteria  of  possible  andic, 
nitic/ferralic  characteristics.  Water  holding  capacities  and  bulk  densities  were  obtained.  Topsoil  samples   
were  also  analyzed  to  find  out  the  fertility  status.  Parameters  examined  were  pH  (H    2O  and  1N  KCl),  total   
organic  carbon  (TOC)  (Walkley    -Black  Method),  total  nitrogen  (TN)  (Kjeldahl  Method),  Carbon  and  nitrogen     
(C/N)  ratio,  ava  ilable  calcium  (Ca),  magnesium  (Mg),  Potassium  (K)  and  sodium  (Na)  (ammonium  acetate -   
0.5N  and  EDTA+0.02M  at  pH4.65  followed  by  atomic  absorption measurement)  and  available  Phosphorous 
(P)  (by  colorimetry).  Mineral  P  for  selected  horizons  from  representativ   e  pedons  was  analyzed  by    
mineralization  with  H 2SO 4-6N  and  phosphate  retention  by  the  same  method  as  active  aluminum  (Al)  and     
iron (Fe) (Blakemore method) and was read by colorimetry.       
Crop Yield Measurement Procedure        
Adopting  the  procedure  from  Hauser  (1973   ),  crop  yields  were  measured.  A  rectangular  harvest  frame  was  
established  in  a  plot  in  which  three  -crop  rows  were  enclosed.  To  delineate  the  frame  dimensions,  the   
formula  XY  =  10  m   2 was  used.  X  as  the  reference,  is  the  width  of  frame  which  is  three  times  t he  crop  row   
distance  in  meters  measured  on  center.  Y  is  the  length  of  the  frame  in  meters  and  the  frame  area  is  10  m   2.  
The  four  corners  were  marked  with  metal  pegs  and  the  enclosed  area  was  cordoned  with  a  nylon  rope. 
Weights  of  crop  harvest  and  plant  dens    ities  within  the  enclosed  area  were  taken.  Three  pieces  of  the    
harvested  root  crops  (potatoes  and  carrots)  which  were  chosen  randomly  were  brought  to  the  laboratory 
for the soil weight correction factor determination. Corn cobs were dehusked, dried and she lled and weights    
were taken at 12% moisture content at which these were safe for storage (   Granados, 2000  ).  
Application of Statistical Methods      
By  Minitab  16,  the  Two  -Sample  T  test was  used  to determine  the differences  of soil  nutrient  levels  between   
Salsala n  and  Mambuaw.  Linear  correlations  test  and  rank  correlations  test  were  applied  to  detect  the     
associations of soil fertility nutrient levels with crop yields.        
Results     and Discussion      
Morphological Characteristics       
There  are  two  main  soil  types  in  Miarayon  ac    cording  to  the  World  Reference  Base  for  Soil  Resources  (   FAO,    
2006    ). Soils in open positions such as convex to steep side are Cambisols. Those on concave to flat positions   
are Umbrisols which were derived from either colluvial or alluvial deposits from volc   anic materials. Test for    
allophanes  confirmed  the  presence  of  amorphous  components  in  all  pedons.  Analyses  of  selected 
representative  samples  indicated  some  “andic”  properties.  Table  1  presents  the  soil  classification  and 
characteristics of the soil pedons   of Salsalan and Mambuaw production locations.

Umbrisols  have  deeply  drained,  medium  textured  soils  with  dark,  acid  surface  horizon,  rich  in  organic 
matter  with  a  base saturation of  <50%  in  the Umbric  horizon (    Driessen et al.,  2001  ). Soils  in  P 4 and  P    5 have  
brownish black topsoil, sandy loam to sandy clay loam texture, pH values of 5.0 and 5.2 at surface horizons, 
base  saturation  of  6.2  and  16.1%  and  with  goo   d  drainage.  Cambisols  occur  in  the  stage  of  early  soil     
development  in  widely  different  environment.  They  are  medium -textured  and  have  a  good  structural   
stability, high porosity, good water holding capacity and good internal drainage (  Driessen et al., 2001   ). Soils    
in P    7 and P 8 have sandy clay loam in the top horizon and silty clay loam to silty clay in the sub horizons, have   
very high to high porosity and with 35.8 and 52.9% field capacity, respectively.        
Soil Fertility Assessment       
Table  2  presents  the  topsoil     nutrient  analyses  results  in  potato,  carrot  and  corn  plots.  Of  the  24  plots    
investigated, 71% had pH <5.5. No value had exceeded 5.9. Of the 12 plots in Mambuaw, except for one plot, 
the  pH  values  were  <5.5.  Soils  with  pH  value  <5.5,  has  high  P  retention    and  plants  are  at  risk  of  Al  toxicity    
(Landon,  1991  ).  Exchangeable  Al  in  the  surface  horizon  of  P  7 and  P    8 had  1.59  and  1.81  cmol    +kg -1  
respectively. However, high CEC in P    7 and P 8 (42.0 and 38.9 cmol   +kg -1, respectively) would buffer the risk. It     
was  noted  t   hat  available  P  was  very  low  (<1mg/100g),  thus  follow  up  analyses  were  made  on  selected  soil     
horizon samples from representative plots for organic P to get P retention. The P retained as the percentage 
of organic P in the total P ranged from 60  -95%.

Miarayon  farmers  primarily  use  chicken  manures  which  were  mixed  with  rice  hulls  as  fertilizers  before 
planting and     therefore are external sources of TOC and part of TN. TOC contents was medium and TN values    
are  medium  to  high.  C/N  ratio  indicates  the  degree  of  organic  humification  and  thus  higher  values  imply 
abundance of less decomposed crop residues. C/N ratios in S alsalan indicated higher degree of humification     
than in Mambuaw.

The  predominance  of  Ca  in  both  locations  can  be  attributed  to  the  parent  rock  of  Miarayon  soils.  Chicken 
manure  applications  can  be  possible  external  source  of  Ca  because  poultry  feed  formul   as  have  Ca  such  as  
mono  dicalcium  phosphate,  limestone,  oyster  shells  and  other  Ca -source  ingredients.  Low  Ca  values  and     
response  of  Ca  fertilizer  in  most  crops  is  when  the  level  is  <0.2  cmol +kg -1 and  the  high  value  is  about  10     
cmol    +kg -1 (Landon,  1991   ).  Of   the  24  plots,  none  of  its  Ca  had  gone  to  the  low  level  and  50%  of  these  were  
above  of  what  is  considered  high.  High  Ca  availability  in  soil  can  be  explained  by  its  affinity  with  exchange 
complexes  of  soil  organic  matter  (SOM),  allophanes,  kaolinite  and  ox   ides  of  Fe  and  Al  (    Camberato  and  Pan,    
2000    ) which were also found in Miarayon soils. Magnesium deficiency occurs when its exchangeable level is   
<0.2 cmol   +kg -1 but in the tropics 0.5 cmol  +kg -1 is the threshold (   Landon  , 1991  ). Forty five per cent of the tota  l   
samples  were  above  the  limit,  38%  were  on  the  threshold  and  17%  were  below  the  limit.    Compared  to  Ca, 
the  low  Mg  availability  can  be  attributed  to  the  nutrient’s  less  affinity  to  soil  exchange  complexes  than  Ca 
(Camberato  and  Pan,  2000 )  in  Miarayon  soil   s  making  this  nutrient  susceptible  to  leaching.  Less  absorption     
of  Mg  may  also  occur  because  of  high  Ca  levels  in  the  soil.  If  Ca/Mg  ratios  >5,  Mg  may  progressively  be 
unavailable  (  Landon,  1991   ).  Of  the  24  samples  analyzed,  83%  had  ratios  >5.  Available  K  o f  0.20 -1.18   
cmol    +kg -1 in  Miarayon  soils  is  considered medium  to  high  for  tropical soils.  CEC  enables  soil  to  retain K  and    
the  amount  of  clay  and  SOM  influence  the  degree  of  leaching  (    Sparks,  2000   ).  Miarayon  soils  have  high  CEC    
and  SOM.  Mg  uptake  can  also  b e  affected  by  K  in  soils.  At  K/Mg  ratios  >2,  Mg  uptake  is  inhibited  and  only     
three plots are at this ratio which were all planted with carrots in Salsalan.      
Soil Fertility Levels Between Salsalan and Mambuaw      
Table  3  shows  the  differences  in  soil  fertility  l   evels  between  the  two  production  locations.  Because  of  the  
time    -length  difference  in  using  the  land,  it  was  assumed  that  both  locations  have  different  states  of  soil  
fertility.

The differences in TOC, TN and K between two locations were very highly significant, and in pH and Ca were 
significan  t.  Soil  fertility  in  Salsalan  is  better  than  in  Mambuaw.  Results  suggested  that  TOC,  TN  and  K  were     
severely  affected  by  long  and  continuous  cultivation.  Continuous  cropping  is  a  slow  process  of  soil  nutrient 
mining  which  will  exhaust  the  soil’s  capacity  to  support  plants.  Less  or  no  replenishment  of  nutrients  can  
deplete the soil fertility in the long run.  Miarayon soils which are derived from volcanic parent materials are 
acidic. There is significant difference between the pH values of the two locations.     The presence of humus   -Al     
and Fe complexes with layer silicates in clay lowers the soil pH (<5) because under humid conditions cations 
that  are  liberated  during the  weathering  process  are  washed  out  from  the  soil  while  Al and  Fe  are  bound in 
humus  (    Mizota  a   nd  van  Reeuwijk,  1989    ).  Topsoils  in  Mambuaw  has  relatively  low  pH  (<5)  and  in  this    
location high amounts of exchangeable Al in soil were detected.     
Available  Ca  was  significantly  higher  in  Salsalan  than  in  Mambuaw.  This  may  mean  that  Ca  leaching  or 
washing     out is lesser in Salsalan than in Mambuaw. Like Ca, there is significant difference in pH between the   
two  locations  because  Ca  influences  the  soil  pH  (   Bear  and  Toth,  1948  ).  The  variation  of  available  Mg  were     
not detected which could mean that this nutrient     is not affected by cultivation duration. The non   -significant    
difference in available Na between the two sites may be due to the nutrient’s low amounts.      
Crop Yields and Plant Densities     
Crop plot sizes of vegetable production areas in Miarayon do not exceed  half a hectare. The plot modal class   
size of potatoes was from 250   -750 m  2 with smallest area of 60 m    2 and the largest was 3,644 m   2. Carrot areas     
modal  class  size  was  from  1,250    -1,750  m   2 with  smallest  area  of  409  m  2 and  the  largest,  4,178  m  2.  For  corn,  
the  plot modal class size was from 500 -1,500 m    2 with the smallest area of 127 m   2 and the largest was 6,386     
m2.  Supply  of  potatoes  in  Northern  Mindanao  comes  from  Bukidnon  and  majority  is  produced  in  Miarayon.    
Carrot production significantly contributes to the   national volume as Bukidnon ranks fifth in the Philippines

(BAS,  2013 ).  Farmers  in  Miarayon  raise  the  native  corn  for  food.  Corn  is  in  rotation  with  potatoes  and    
carrots which does not include application of fertilizers for maintenance.      
Table  4  shows  the     crop  yields  of  potatoes,  carrot  and  corn.  Farmers  in  Miarayon  practice  direct  seeding  
when planting carrots and corn. For carrots, thinning comes after one month to control the plant population. 
The  table  further  shows  the  plant  densities  of  carrots  and  c  orn  in  the  plot.  Carrot  plant  densities  were     
obtained by counting the individual tap root and for corn, the individual stalk inside the harvest frame.

Mean yield of potatoes in Salsalan is higher than in Mambuaw. Potato yields i   n Salsalan were comparable to   
the  Miarayon  region  yields  13  years  ago.  Potato  adaptation  trial  results  by  Tatoy  et  al.  (2001)   in  Miarayon,  
Lirongan  and  San  Miguel  had  yields  of  26.16,  23.19  and  25.63  tha -1 respectively.  Mean  carrot  yield  in   
Salsalan  is  les   s  than  in  Mambuaw  by  2.35  tha -1.  Mean  yields  in  two  locations  were  higher  than  the  2012    
Bukidnon  Province  carrot  average  yield  which  was  10.72  tha  -1 (BAS,  2013  ).  Mean  yield  of  corn  does  not    
differ significantly in both production areas. Miarayon yield was   almost twice as much as the 2012 Bukidnon   
white  corn  yield  of  1.88  tha   -1 (BAS,  2013  )  although  farmers  do  not  apply  fertilizers  to  corn  plots.  Corn   
cropping  that  do  not  use  fertilizer  follows  potato  or  carrot  production.  Corn  may  have  benefited  the  slow 
rel ease of nutrients applied in the previous cropping.     
Calibration of Crop Yields with Soil Fertility Levels       
Table  5  shows  the  statistical  analysis  results  for  yields  with  soil  nutrient  levels.  Potato  yields  were  highly 
correlated  with  TOC,  TN,  available  Ca,     K  and  fairly  associated  with  pH  H 2O.  There  is  inverse  relationship   
between  potato  yield  and  C/N  ratio.  In  this  study,  there  was  no  association  detected  between  potato  yield 
and  Mg  availability  although  the  nutrient  is  important  to  the  crop.  This  could  mean     that  available  Mg  is  not   
affected  by  potato  cultivation.  There  is  no  relationship  between  potato  yields  and  Na  because  of  its  low 
quantity  and  Na  is  not  a  critical  element  for  any  crop  unless  its  concentration  in  soil  is  beyond  crop 
tolerance.

At this level of investigation, there was no relationship detected between carrot yields and soil nutrients, yet 
some observations were drawn from crop behavior     in response to topsoil quality. Optimum pH requirement  
for  carrots  is  6.0  (    Rubatzky,  1999 )  and  all  carrot  plots  fell  below  the  condition.    However,  carrot  yields  in    
these areas were higher than the Bukidnon values. In Mambuaw, the plot with the highest car rot yield (MC   3)  
also  had  the  highest  TOC  (8.7%),  TN  (0.6%)  and  sum  of  available  bases  (3.17  cmol  +kg -1).  The  plot  with  the  
lowest  yield  (MC  1)  has  also  the  lowest  TOC  (4.1%),  TN  (0.3%)  and  sum  of  available  bases  (2.61  cmol   +kg -1).    
For Salsalan, the plots with     low yields had K/Mg ratio of >2 (SC    2, 3.5:1 and SC 4, 3.4:1) in which at this values   
may inhibit the uptake of Mg (  Landon, 1991    ). Moreover, according to the plot owners these were affected by    
long dry days during their early stage of planting. Miarayon cro    ps are rain -fed. Carrots like a uniform supply     
of  water  throughout  the  growing  season  (  Fritz  et  al.,  2013   )  and  hot  sunny  days  can  injure  or  kill  the  young     
plants.      Plant densities of these two plots were 104 and 84 plants per 10 m 2 only which were less tha  n half of   
the  average  modal  carrot  plant  densities.  The  plot  with  the  highest  yield  value  was  that  the  crop  was 
harvested the latest although its K/Mg ratio is 2.9. In Miarayon, the schedule of harvest is dictated by the plot 
financiers who watch the commo  dity market trends. Plant density shows that the sizes of the carrots in this   
plot were much bigger than the average tubers. Compared to the three groups of crop plots, carrot plots had 
low available Mg. Soil tests <50 ppm (<0.41 cmol    +kg -1) are considered  low (   Fritz et al., 2013  ).  
Corn yields had high correlation with available Ca, Mg and K. One can assume that corn apparently responds 
to  different  levels  of  available  bases.  In  this  study,  there  was  no  sign  of  linkage  with  the  rest  of  the  soil 
nutrients. Th   e K/Mg ratio had ranged from 0.5 to 1.7 which were below the limit of >2. Therefore, Mg uptake  
may not be severely affected by the presence of K in soils. The pH requirement for corn ranges from 5.0 -8.0,   
with  optimal  values  of  6.0  -7.0,  and  N  is  the most im  portant nutrient  ( Landon, 1991    ).  Although  pH  values  of    
Miarayon soils fell into the low boundary, corn grows well because of the high TN in soils.         
Conclusion      
Miarayon  soils  can  still  be  considered  as  fertile  however,  the  long  periods  of  cultivation  had  de    pleted  the     
basic  nutrients  in  topsoil.  Low  soil  pH  in  the  old  settlement  would  pose  the  risk  of  Al  toxicity.  However, 
momentarily this is cushioned by high CEC which is inherent in soils derived from volcanic parent materials 
although  the  base  saturation  r  atios  were  low.  Available  Ca  was  influential  in  the  soil  pH.  In  this  study,  the   
differences  of  Mg  and  Na  levels  between  the  two  locations  were  not  significant.  TOC,  TN,  C/N  ratio  and  K 
may drastically be affected by long cultivation unless soil improvement s are made. Yield of potatoes, carrots  
and corn are higher than the recent provincial average yield values. Soil pH, TOC, TN, C/N ratio, available Ca, 
K  can  be  useful  to  estimate  the  yield  of  potatoes.  In  this  investigation,  there  is  obscurity  in  using  soi l   
nutrients as indicators for carrot yield. Corn yield can be predicted at certain levels of available Ca, Mg and K. 
Established SRS is baseline information that can be useful for Miarayon farmers in assessing the soil fertility. 
Crop yield data may enable   Miarayon farmers to estimate the plot production capacity at given soil nutrient   
levels. The methodology that was developed can be replicated in other highland areas of Mindanao. This can 
serve  as  model  to  be  adopted  by  highland  farming  communities  in  gen  erating  soil  information  at  the  local  
level.

        // DB::insert('insert into journals values(?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)', [NULL,'Economic Difficulty and Coping Strategies of Low Income Faculty Members as Related to their Teaching Performance','Ronaldo F. Frufonga','2015-09-29',"This study ascertained the relationship between difficulties and coping strategies as related to teaching performance of West Visayas State University-Janiuay Campus (WVSU-JC) faculty for the School Year 2014-2015. The survey-correlational method was used with teaching performance as dependent variables, experienced economic difficulties as the independent variable, and coping strategy as moderator variable. The participants in the study were the 52 faculty who were selected through purposive sampling. Data were gathered through a researcher-made questionnaire-checklist and Faculty Performance Evaluation System. The statistical tools used were frequency count, rank, mean, standard deviation, and Pearson's Product-Moment Coefficient of Correlation. All statistical computations were availed of through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Results revealed that the top economic difficulty experienced by faculty was limited cash. The topmost coping strategy employed by faculty was buying only basic foods or things for household. The faculty also experienced economic difficulty to a 'moderate extent.' Nevertheless, the performance of the faculty was found to be “outstanding.” Teachers were affected by such financial crisis. However, despite their experienced economic difficulties, as major agents for change, they performed their best for the improvement of quality education. No significant relationships existed between coping strategies and teaching performance of faculty.",'RegionIII','Social Science','http://res.cloudinary.com/dzhe5doam/image/upload/c_fit/sq7yu93wvwntpllnevqd.pdf','HAHAHAHAAHAH',NULL,NULL]);

Capinpin, Jr.','2012-05-01','The objectives of the present study were to (1) determine the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of abalone gatherers through interviews and mentoring, and assess the correspondence between scientific information and LEK, so that areas where local knowledge may be most useful in resource management could be identified, and (2) to empower selected gatherers/farmers with knowledge and technical skills through environmental education to help develop or build their capacity to become sustainable resource managers. The LEK of abalone fishers was determined using three complementary approaches – group interview, individual interview, and mentoring sessions. Local fishers possess a wealth of knowledge about the interactions of species gained through many years of observations, and this knowledge may be useful in guiding biologists in ecological restoration or management regimes. Additionally, the fishers’ LEK, validated by modern scientific ecological findings, could be a source of important and effective ideas in resource management. The knowledge of the abalone gatherers about important abalone fishing grounds should help in pinpointing critical areas that need to be managed. Abalone mariculture in cages should be set up in these areas to routinely create dense breeding populations which can help in enhancing recovery and in providing fishers with a source of additional income. The continued enforcement of marine protected areas and the periodic release or reseeding of abalone in sanctuaries could also be considered viable resource management options. Other recommendations for resource management based on gathered local knowledge and lessons learned from the environmental education (EE) seminars are also presented.','RegionIII','Ecology','http://res.cloudinary.com/dzhe5doam/image/upload/c_fit/izif5qenaadd15kua7nw.pdf','HAHAHAHAAHAH',NULL,NULL]);

Asido Jr., Liana Talaue-McManus','2000-12-01','The Coastal Development Plan that was passed into law as the Municipal Fisheries Ordinance of Bolinao, Pangasinan, is a concrete example of community participation in policy development. Among the effective metalegal strategies used during the evolution of the plan into an ordinance were the lobbies staged by the federation of people’s organizations (KAISAKA), the Municipal Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Council (MFARMC), and the Municipal Mayor. The capacity of various sectors to participate actively in the passage of the plan was enhanced through legal consultations and training provided by the Marine Fisheries Resources Management Project, in partnership with Tanggol Kalikasan, the legal arm of Haribon Foundation. The experience underscores the need for development projects to include the metalegal training of community constituents as a requisite for the latter to actively participate in the formulation of policies and laws for coastal resources management.','RegionIII','Metallurgy','http://res.cloudinary.com/dzhe5doam/image/upload/c_fit/kllquxwxugolm7rrrp4g.pdf','HAHAHAHAAHAH',NULL,NULL]);
